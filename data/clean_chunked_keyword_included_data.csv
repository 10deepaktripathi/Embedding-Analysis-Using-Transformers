8,preoperative diagnoses airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. postoperative diagnoses airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. operation performed neck exploration tracheostomy urgent flexible bronchoscopy via tracheostomy site removal of foreign body tracheal metallic stent material dilation distal trachea placement of 8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube. indications for surgery the patient is a 50yearold white male with history of progressive tracheomalacia treated in the national tennessee and several years ago he had a tracheal metallic stent placed with some temporary improvement. however developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement. subsequently he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the abc hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on month dd yyyy. he underwent bronchoscopy by dr. w and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes. the patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and laryngology and thoracic surgery services were consulted for further management. exploration of trachea removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
9,nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding infection alteration of voice speech swallowing voice changes permanently possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway loss of voice cardiac risk factors anesthetic risks recurrence of problems upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length. the patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed. description of procedure the patient was taken to the operating room placed in the supine position. following adequate monitoring by anesthesia service to maintain sedation the patients neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. the neck was then infiltrated with 1 xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine. a collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle this was an outline incision was carried out. the skin subcutaneous tissue platysma subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly. strap muscles were separated in the midline dissection carried down to visceral fascia. beneath the strap muscles there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks. there appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable. there was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus. thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation attachment of the thyroid isthmus fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection. trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
10,the trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation. the tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness. the trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted. the patient however was able to ventilate at this point a 6 endo tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered. once the airway was secured we then proceeded working around the 6 endo tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site. examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea. a careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis. after removal of the stents and granulation tissue the upper trachea was widely patent. the mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation. stent material was removed from this area as well. in the distal third of the trachea a third stent was embedded within the mucosa not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time. all visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
11,initial attempt to place a 16 montgomery t tube showed the distal lumen of the t tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third. also this was removed and a 8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube. a good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa. the distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent. this secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time. neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 30 vicryl. the skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 20 prolene. tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 20 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition. the patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
12,procedure eeg during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of moderateamplitude beta activity seen bilaterally. the eeg background is symmetric. independent small positive sharp wave activity is seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharpslow wave discharges seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region. no clinical signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring. recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds. there is attenuation of the background faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is recorded. no sustained epileptogenic activity is evident but the independent bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently. photic stimulation induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response. impression eeg during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with independent positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head regions more predominant in the right frontotemporal region. the eeg findings are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process. clinical correlation is warranted.,Neurology
13,doctors address dear doctor this letter is an introduction to my patient a who you will be seeing in the near future. he is a pleasant gentleman with a history of wilsons disease. it has been treated with penicillamine. he was diagnosed with this at age 14. he was on his way to south carolina for a trip when he developed shortness of breath palpitations and chest discomfort. he went to the closest hospital that they were near in randolph north carolina and he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid rate. he was admitted there and observed. he converted to normal sinus rhythm spontaneously and so he required no further interventions. he was started on lopressor which he has tolerated well. an echocardiogram was performed which revealed mildtomoderate left atrial enlargement. normal ejection fraction. no other significant valvular abnormality. he reported to physicians there that he had cirrhosis related to his wilsons disease. therefore hepatologist was consulted. there was a recommendation to avoid coumadin secondary to his questionable significant liver disease therefore he was placed on aspirin 325 mg once a day. in discussion with mr. a and review of his chart that i have available it is unclear as to the status of his liver disease however he has never had a liver biopsy so his diagnosis of cirrhosis that they were concerned about in north carolina is in doubt.,Neurology
14,his lfts have remained normal and his copper level has been undetectable on his current dose of penicillamine. i would appreciate your input into the long term management of his anticoagulation and also any recommendations you would have about rhythm control. he is in normal sinus rhythm as of my evaluation of him on 06122008. he is tolerating his metoprolol and aspirin without any difficulty. i guess the big question remains is what level of risk that is entailed by placing him on coumadin therapy due to his potentially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and evidence of left atrial enlargement that would place him in increased risk of recurrent episodes. i appreciate your input regarding this friendly gentleman. his current medicines include penicillamine 250 mg p.o. four times a day metoprolol 12.5 mg twice a day and aspirin 325 mg a day. if you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me to discuss his case. otherwise i will look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation. thank you as always for your care of our patient.,Neurology

33,title of operation right suboccipital craniectomy for resection of tumor using the microscope modifier 22 and cranioplasty. indication for surgery the patient with a large 3.5 cm acoustic neuroma. the patient is having surgery for resection. there was significant cerebellar peduncle compression. the tumor was very difficult due to its size as well as its adherence to the brainstem and the nerve complex. the case took 12 hours. this was more difficult and took longer than the usual acoustic neuroma. preop diagnosis right acoustic neuroma. postop diagnosis right acoustic neuroma. procedure the patient was brought to the operating room. general anesthesia was induced in the usual fashion. after appropriate lines were placed the patient was placed in mayfield 3point head fixation hold into a right park bench position to expose the right suboccipital area. a timeout was settled with nursing and anesthesia and the head was shaved prescrubbed with chlorhexidine prepped and draped in the usual fashion. the incision was made and cautery was used to expose the suboccipital bone. once the suboccipital bone was exposed under the foramen magnum the high speed drill was used to thin out the suboccipital bone and the craniectomy carried out with leksell and insertion with kerrison punches down to the rim of the foramen magnum as well as laterally to the edge of the sigmoid sinus and superiorly to the edge of the transverse sinus.,Neurology
34,the dura was then opened in a cruciate fashion the cisterna magna was drained which nicely relaxed the cerebellum. the dura leaves were held back with the 40 nurolon. the microscope was then brought into the field and under the microscope the cerebellar hemisphere was elevated. laterally the arachnoid was very thick. this was opened with bipolar and microscissors and this allowed for the cerebellum to be further mobilized until the tumor was identified. the tumor was quite large and filled up the entire lateral aspect of the right posterior fossa. initially two retractors were used one on the tentorium and one inferiorly. the arachnoid was taken down off the tumor. there were multiple blood vessels on the surface which were bipolared. the tumor surface was then opened with microscissors and the cavitron was used to began debulking the lesion. this was a very difficult resection due to the extreme stickiness and adherence to the cerebellar peduncle and the lateral cerebellum however as the tumor was able to be debulked the edge began to be mobilized. the redundant capsule was bipolared and cut out to get further access to the center of the tumor. working inferiorly and then superiorly the tumor was taken down off the tentorium as well as out the 9th 10th or 11th nerve complex. it was very difficult to identify the 7th nerve complex. the brainstem was identified above the complex.,Neurology
35,similarly inferiorly the brainstem was able to be identified and cotton balls were placed to maintain this plain. attention was then taken to try identify the 7th nerve complex. there were multitude of veins including the lateral pontine vein which were coming right into this area. the lateral pontine vein was maintained. microscissors and bipolar were used to develop the plain and then working inferiorly the 7th nerve was identified coming off the brainstem. a number 1 and number 2 microinstruments were then used to began to develop the plane. this then allowed for the further appropriate plane medially to be identified and cotton balls were then placed. a number 11 and number 1 microinstrument continued to be used to free up the tumor from the widely spread out 7th nerve. cavitron was used to debulk the lesion and then further dissection was carried out. the nerve stimulated beautifully at the brainstem level throughout this. the tumor continued to be mobilized off the lateral pontine vein until it was completely off. the cavitron was used to debulk the lesion out back laterally towards the area of the porus. the tumor was debulked and the capsule continued to be separated with number 11microinstrument as well as the number 1 microinstrument to roll the tumor laterally up towards the porus. at this point the capsule was so redundant it was felt to isolate the nerve in the porus. there was minimal bulk remaining intracranially.,Neurology
36,all the cotton balls were removed and the nerve again stimulated beautifully at the brainstem. dr. x then came in and scrubbed into the case to drill out the porus and remove the piece of the tumor that was left in the porus and coming out of the porus. i then scrubbed back into case once dr. x had completed removing this portion of the tumor. there was no tumor remaining at this point. i placed some norian in the porus to seal any air cells although there were no palpated. an intradural space was then irrigated thoroughly. there was no bleeding. the nerve was attempted to be stimulated at the brainstem level but it did not stimulate at this time. the dura was then closed with 40 nurolons in interrupted fashion. a muscle plug was used over one area. duragen was laid and strips over the suture line followed by hemaseel. gelfoam was set over this and then a titanium cranioplasty was carried out. the wound was then irrigated thoroughly. o vicryls were used to close the deep muscle and fascia 30 vicryl for subcutaneous tissue and 30 nylon on the skin. the patient was extubated and taken to the icu in stable condition.,Neurology
37,chief complaint severe back pain and sleepiness. the patient is not a good historian and history was obtained from the patients husband at bedside. history of present illness the patient is a 76yearold obese caucasian female with past medical conditions that includes hypertension history of urinary incontinence dementia and chronic back pain basically brought by the husband to the emergency room because of having excruciating back pain. as per the husband the patient has this back pain for about almost 1 year and seeing dr. x in neurosurgery and had an epidural injection x2 and then the patients pain somewhat got better between but last time the patient went to see dr. x the patient given injection and the patient passed out so the doctor stopped giving any other epidural injection. the patient has severe pain and all in all the patient cries at home. as per the husband the patient woke up in the morning with severe pain unable to eat drink today and crying in the morning so brought her to the emergency room for further evaluation. the patient denied any history of fever cough chest pain diarrhea dysuria or polyuria. while i was examining the patient the patient explained about possible diagnosis and treatment plan and possible nursing home discharge for pain control. the patient passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes unable to respond to even painful stimuli.,Neurology
38,the patients heart rate went down to 50s and blood pressure was 92 systolic so the patient was later on given iv fluid and blood pressure checked. the patient woke up after 5 to 6 minutes so the patient was later on evaluated for admission because of near syncopal episode. past medical conditions include hypertension dementia urinary incontinence chronic back pain and degenerative joint disease of the spine. no history of diabetes stroke or coronary artery disease. surgical history include left total hip replacement many years ago history of hysterectomy and appendectomy in the young age. allergies denied. current medications according to the list shows the patient takes hydrocodone 10325 mg every 6 hours flexeril 10 mg p.o. at bedtime and xanax 0.25 mg p.o. 4 times a day. the patient also takes neurontin 200 mg 3 times a day propranolol 10 mg twice a day oxybutynin 5 mg p.o. twice a day namenda 10 mg p.o. daily and aricept 10 mg p.o. daily. social history she lives with her husband usually walks with a walker and wheelchairbound does not walk much as per the husband knows. no history of alcohol abuse or smoking. physical examination general currently lying in the bed without apparent distress very lethargic. vital signs pulse rate of 55 blood pressure is 9252 after iv fluid came up to 10558. chest shows bilateral air entry present clear to auscultate. heart s1 and s2 regular. abdomen soft nondistended and nontender.,Neurology
39,extremities shows the patients straight leg raising to be only up to 30 causing the patient severe back pain. imaging the patients xray of the lumbosacral spine done shows there is a l1 compression fracture with some osteophyte formation in the lumbar spine suggestive of degenerative joint disease. laboratory data the patients lab test is not done currently but previous lab test done in 32009 seems to be in acceptable range. impression the patient because of near syncopal episode and polypharmacy almost passed out for about 3 to 4 minutes in front of me with a low blood pressure. vasovagal syncope versus polypharmacy because of 3 to 4 medications and muscle relaxants. osteoporosis of the spine with l1 compression fracture causing the patient severe pain. hypertension now hypotension. incontinence of the bladder. dementia most likely alzheimer type. plan and suggestion initial plan was to send the patient to the nursing home but because of the patients low blood pressure and heart rate low we will admit the patient to dou for 23hour observation start the patient on iv fluid normal saline 20 meq kcl and protonix 40 mg and we will also continue the patients namenda and aricept. i will hold the patients hydrocodone. i will hold the flexeril and i will also hold gabapentin at this moment. we will give the patients pain control with percocet and very minimal morphine sulfate as needed. also give the patient calcium with vitamin d and physical therapy.,Neurology
40,we will also order a blood test and further management will be based on the patients all test results. i also explained to the husband that tomorrow if the patient is better and more alert and awake then we will send her to the nursing care versus home it depends on the pain control.,Neurology
41,subjective the patient is a 55yearold africanamerican male that was last seen in clinic on 07292008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an mri scan which demonstrated right contrastenhancing temporal mass. given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures it is significantly concerning for a highgrade glioma. objective the patient is alert and oriented times three gcs of 15. cranial nerves ii to xii are grossly intact. motor exam demonstrates 55 strength in all four extremities. sensation is intact to light touch pain temperature and proprioception. cerebellar exam is intact. gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes. speech is appropriate. judgment is intact. pupils are equal and reactive to light. assessment and plan the patient is a 55yearold africanamerican male with a new diagnosis of rimenhancing right temporal mass. given the characteristics of the mri scan it is highly likely that he demonstrates highgrade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme. we have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy surgical resection medical management as well as chemotherapy radiation treatments and doing nothing. given the high probability that the mass represents a highgrade glioma the patient after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a highgrade glioma. the patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor.,Neurology

49,chief complaint status epilepticus. history of present illness the patient is a 6yearold male who is a former 27week premature infant who suffered an intraventricular hemorrhage requiring shunt placement and as a result has developmental delay and left hemiparesis. at baseline he can put about 2 to 4 words together in brief sentences. his speech is not always easily understood however he is in a special education classroom in kindergarten. he ambulates independently but falls often. he has difficulty with his left side compared to the right and prefers to use the right upper extremity more than the left. mother reports he postures the left upper extremity when running. he is being followed by medical therapy unit and has also been seen in the past by dr. x. he has not received botox or any other interventions with regard to his cerebral palsy. the patient did require one shunt revision but since then his shunt has done well. the patient developed seizures about 2 years ago. these occurred periodically but they are always in the same and with the involvement of the left side more than right and he had an eye deviation forcefully to the left side. his events however always tend to be prolonged. he has had seizures as long as an hour and a half. he tends to require multiple medications to stop them. he has been followed by dr. y and was started on trileptal.,Neurology
50,at one point the patient was taken off his medication for presumed failure to prevent his seizures. he was more recently placed on topamax since march 2007. his last seizures were in march and may respectively. he is worked up to a dose of 25 mg capsules 2 capsules twice a day or about 5 mgkgday at this point. the patient was in his usual state of health until early this morning and was noted to be in seizure. his seizure this morning was similar to the previous seizures with forced deviation of his head and eyes to the left side and convulsion more on the left side than the right. family administered diastat 7.5 mg x1 dose. they did not know they could repeat this dose. ems was called and he received lorazepam 2 mg and then in the emergency department 15 mgkg of fosphenytoin. his seizures stopped thereafter since that time he had gradually become more alert and is eating and is nearly back to baseline. he is a bit off balance and tends to be a bit weaker on the left side compared to baseline postictally. review of systems at this time he is positive for a lowgrade fever he has had no signs of illness otherwise. he does have some fevers after his prolonged seizures. he denies any respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. there is no numbness or loss of skills. he has no rashes arthritis or arthralgias. he has no oropharyngeal complaints. visual or auditory complaints.,Neurology
51,past medical history also positive for some mild scoliosis. social history the patient lives at home with mother father and 2 other siblings. there are no ill contacts. family history noncontributory. physical examination general the patient is a wellnourished wellhydrated male in no acute distress. vital signs his vital signs are stable and he is currently afebrile. heent atraumatic and normocephalic. oropharynx shows no lesions. neck supple without adenopathy. chest clear to auscultation. cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm no murmurs. abdomen benign without organomegaly. extremities no clubbing cyanosis or edema. neurologic the patient is alert and will follow instructions. his speech is very dysarthric and he tends to run his words together. he is about 50 understandable at best. he does put words and sentences together. his cranial nerves reveal his pupils are equal round and reactive to light. his extraocular movements are intact. his visual fields are full. disks are sharp bilaterally. his face shows left facial weakness postictally. his palate elevates midline. vision is intact bilaterally. tongue protrudes midline. motor exam reveals clearly decreased strength on the left side at baseline. his left thigh is abducted at the hip at rest with the right thigh and leg straight. he has difficulty using the left arm and while reaching for objects shows exaggerated tremordysmetria. right upper extremity is much more on target. his sensations are intact to light touch bilaterally. deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric.,Neurology
52,when sitting up he shows some truncal instability and tendency towards decreased truncal tone and kyphosis. he also shows some scoliotic curve of the spine which is mild at this point. gait was not tested today. impression this is a 6yearold male with recurrent status epilepticus left hemiparesis history of prematurity and intraventricular hemorrhage. he is on topamax which is at a moderate dose of 5 mgkg a day or 50 mg twice a day. at this point it is not clear whether this medication will protect him or not but the dose is clearly not at maximum and he is tolerating the dose currently. the plan will be to increase him up to 50 mg in the morning and 75 mg at night for 2 weeks and then 75 mg twice daily. reviewed the possible side effects of higher doses of topamax they will monitor him for language issues cognitive problems or excessive somnolence. i also discussed his imaging studies which showed significant destruction of the cerebellum compared to other areas and despite this the patient at baseline has a reasonable balance. the plan from ct standpoint is to continue stretching program continue with medical therapy unit. he may benefit from botox. in addition i reviewed the diastat protocol with parents and given the patient tends to go into status epilepticus each time they can administer diastat immediately and not wait the standard 2 minutes or even 5 minutes that they were waiting before.,Neurology
53,they are going to repeat the dose within 10 minutes and they can call ems at any point during that time. hopefully at home they need to start to abort these seizures or the higher dose of topamax will prevent them. other medication options would include keppra zonegran or lamictal. followup followup has already been scheduled with dr. y in february and they will continue to keep that date for followup.,Neurology
54,city state dear dr. y i had the pleasure of seeing abc today back in neurology clinic where he has been followed previously by dr. z. his last visit was in june 2006 and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy. to review his birth was unremarkable. he is a second child born to a g3 p1 to 2 female. he has had normal development and is a bright child in 7th grade. he began having seizures however at 9 years of age. it is manifested typically as generalized tonicclonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep. he also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching. his eegs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere. most recent eeg in may 2006 shows the same abnormalities. abc initially was placed on tegretol but developed symptoms of toxicity hallucinations on this medication he was switched to trileptal. he has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures. his last event was the day of his last eeg when he was sleep deprived and was off medication. that was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes. he has done well otherwise. parents deny that he has any problems with concentration. he has not had any behavior issues. he is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities. he has one older sibling and he lives with his parents.,Neurology
55,father manages turkey farm with foster farms. mother is an 8th grade teacher. family history is positive for a 3rd cousin who has seizures but the specific seizure type is not known. there is no other relevant family history. review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation. this is perhaps due to sports injury. he has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted. he does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities. he has no rashes or any numbness weakness or loss of skills. he has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. he has no nausea vomiting diarrhea or abdominal complaints. past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. other workup includes ct scan and mri scan of the brain which are both normal. physical examination general the patient is a wellnourished wellhydrated male in no acute distress. vital signs his weight today is 80.6 pounds. height is 5814 inches. blood pressure 11366. head circumference 36.3 cm. heent atraumatic normocephalic. oropharynx shows no lesions. neck supple without adenopathy. chest clear auscultation. cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs. abdomen benign without organomegaly. extremities no clubbing cyanosis or edema. neurologic the patient is alert and oriented. his cognitive skills appear normal for his age. his speech is fluent and goaldirected. he follows instructions well. his cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal round and reactive to light.,Neurology
56,extraocular movements are intact. visual fields are full. disks are sharp bilaterally. face moves symmetrically with normal sensation. palate elevates midline. tongue protrudes midline. hearing is intact bilaterally. motor exam reveals normal strength and tone. sensation intact to light touch and vibration. his gait is nonataxic with normal heeltoe and tandem. fingertonose fingernosefinger rapid altering movements are normal. deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric. impression this is an 11yearold male with benign rolandic epilepsy who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic. most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities but it has not been done since may 2006. the plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal. at that time he will be tapered off of medication. i anticipate at some point in the near future within about a year or so he will actually be taken off medication. for now i will continue on trileptal 300 mg twice a day which is a low starting dose for him. there is no indication that his dose needs to be increased. family understands the plan. we will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months. parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results. thank you very much for allowing me to access abc for further management.,Neurology
57,doctors address dear doctor this letter serves as a reintroduction of my patient a who will be seeing you on thursday as you know he is an unfortunate gentleman who has reflex sympathetic dystrophy of both lower extremities. his current symptoms are more severe on the right and he has had a persisting wound that has failed to heal on his right leg. he has been through wound clinic to try to help heal this but was intolerant of compression dressings and was unable to get satisfactory healing of this. he has been seen by dr. x for his pain management and was considered for the possibility of amputation being a therapeutic option to help reduce his pain. he was seen by dr. y at orthopedic associates for review of this. however in my discussion with dr. z and his evaluation of mr. a it was felt that this may be an imprudent path to take given the lack of likelihood of reduction of his pain from his rst his questionable healing of his wound given noninvasive studies that did reveal tenuous oxygenation of the right lower leg and concerns of worsening of his rst symptoms on his left leg if he would have an amputation. based on the results of his transcutaneous oxygen levels and his dramatic improvement with oxygen therapy at this test dr. z felt that a course of hyperbaric oxygen may be of utility to help in improving his wounds.,Neurology
58,as you may or may not know we have certainly pursued aggressive significant measures to try to improve mr. as pain. he has been to cleveland clinic for implantable stimulator which was unsuccessful at dramatically improving his pain. he currently is taking methadone up to eight tablets four times a day morphine up to 100 mg three times a day and dilaudid two tablets by mouth every two hours to help reduce his pain. he also is currently taking neurontin 1600 mg three times a day effexor xr 250 mg once a day cytomel 25 mcg once a day seroquel 100 mg p.o. q. day levothyroxine 300 mcg p.o. q. day prinivil 20 mg p.o. q. day and mevacor 40 mg p.o. q day. i appreciate your assistance in determining if hyperbaric oxygen is a reasonable treatment course for this unfortunate situation. dr. z and i have both tried to stress the fact that amputation may be an abrupt and irreversible treatment course that may not reach any significant conclusion. he has been evaluated by dr. x for rehab concerns to determine. he agrees that a less aggressive form of therapy may be most appropriate. i thank you kindly for your prompt evaluation of this kind gentleman in an unfortunate situation. if you have any questions regarding his care please feel free to call me at my office. otherwise i look forward to hearing back from you shortly after your evaluation.,Neurology

60,reason for visit followup leftsided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis. history of present illness ms. abc returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity c6 radiculopathy. i had last seen her on 062107. at that time she had been referred to me dr. x and dr. y for evaluation of her leftsided c6 radiculopathy. she also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for leftsided rotator cuff repair surgery i believe on approximately 072007. at our last visit i only had a report of her prior cervical spine mri. i did not have any recent images. i referred her for cervical spine mri and she returns today. she states that her symptoms are unchanged. she continues to have significant leftsided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with dr. y. she also has a second component of pain which radiates down the left arm in a c6 distribution to the level of the wrist. she has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note. no significant right upper extremity symptoms. no bowel bladder dysfunction. no difficulty with ambulation. findings on examination she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups 4 out of 5 left deltoid 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities.,Neurology

65,a 14gauge tuohy needle was introduced into the lumbar subarachnoid space. clear and colorless csf issued forth. a catheter was inserted to a distance of 40 cm and the needle was removed. the catheter was then connected to a closed drainage system for aspiration and infusion. this notouch technique is now a standard of care for treatment of patients with large invasive adenomas. via injections through the lumbar drain one increases intracranial pressure and produces gentle migration of the tumor. this improves outcome and reduces complications by atraumatically dissecting the tumor away from the optic apparatus. the patient was then placed supine and the 3point headrest was affixed. he was placed in the semisitting position with the head turned to the right and a roll placed under the left shoulder. care was taken to pad all pressure points appropriately. the fluoroscope carm unit was then positioned so as to afford an excellent view of the sella and sphenoid sinus in the lateral projection. the metallic arm was then connected to the table for the use of the endoscope. the oropharynx nasopharynx and abdominal areas were then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. a transverse incision was made in the abdominal region and several large pieces of fat were harvested for later use. hemostasis was obtained. the wound was carefully closed in layers. i then advanced a 0degree endoscope up the left nostril. the middle turbinate was identified and reflected laterally exposing the sphenoid sinus ostium.,Neurology
66,needle bovie electrocautery was used to clear mucosa away from the ostium. the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid had already been separated from the sphenoid. i entered into the sphenoid. there was a tremendous amount of dense fibrous scar tissue present and i slowly and carefully worked through all this. i identified a previous sellar opening and widely opened the bone which had largely regrown out to the cavernous sinus laterally on the left which was very well exposed and the cavernous sinus on the right which i exposed the very medial portion of. the opening was wide until i had the horizontal portion of the floor to the tuberculum sella present. the operating microscope was then utilized. working under magnification i used hypophysectomy placed in the nostril. the dura was then carefully opened in the midline and i immediately encountered tissue consistent with pituitary adenoma. a frozen section was obtained which confirmed this diagnosis without malignant features. slowly and meticulously i worked to remove the tumor. i used the suction apparatus as well as the bipolar coagulating forceps and ring and cup curette to begin to dissect tumor free. the tumor was moderately vascular and very fibrotic. slowly and carefully i systematically entered the sellar contents until i could see the cavernous sinus wall on the left and on the right. there appeared to be cavernous sinus invasion on the left. it was consistent with what we saw on the mri imaging.,Neurology
67,the portion working into the suprasellar cistern was slowly dissected down by injecting saline into the lumbar subarachnoid catheter. a large amount of this was removed. there was a csf leak as the tumor was removed for the upper surface of it was very adherent to the arachnoid and could not be separated free. under high magnification i actually worked up into this cavity and performed a very radical excision of tumor. while there may be a small amount of tumor remaining it appeared that a radical excision had been created with decompression of the optic apparatus. in fact i reinserted the endoscope and could see the optic chiasm well. i reasoned that i had therefore achieved the goal with that is of a radical excision and decompression. attention was therefore turned to closure. the wound was copiously irrigated with bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. i asked anesthesiology to perform a valsalva maneuver and there was no evidence of bleeding. attention was turned to closure and reconstruction. i placed a very large piece of fat in the sella to seal the leak and verified that there was no fat in the suprasellar cistern by using fluoroscopy and looking at the pattern of the air. using a polypropylene insert i reconstructed the sellar floor with this implant making a nice tight sling and creating a cranioplasty of less than 5 cm. duraseal was placed over this and the sphenoid sinus was carefully packed with fat and duraseal.,Neurology
68,i inspected the nasal passages and restored the septum precisely to the midline repairing a previous septal deviation. the middle turbinates were then restored to their anatomic position. there was no significant intranasal bleeding and for this reason an open nasal packing was required. sterile dressings were applied and the operation was terminated. the patient tolerated the procedure well and left to the recovery room in excellent condition. the sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications. specimens were sent to pathology consisting of tumor.,Neurology

82,the hypoglossal nerve vagus nerve and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. the neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. the external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. a large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. i then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. it became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore i did use the router i mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. the internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and i drilled carotid canal up until it made. i dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. once this was dissected out dr. x entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. for details please see his operative note. after dr. x had completed the resection i then harvested the rectus free flap.,Neurology
83,a skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. the skin paddle was incised with the bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. the sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. the skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 30 vicryl. the anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle which was then divided superiorly with the bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. the vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. the muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large hemoclips on each vessel. the wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. the rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. the inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 90 ethilon with standard microvascular technique. ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. likewise the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 90 ethilon as well.,Neurology
84,there was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. the wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. the eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. the muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. i removed most the skin of the conchal bowl deepithelializing and leaving the fat in place. the wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 30 vicryl. the skin was closed with skin staples. there was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. the skin paddle was closed with interrupted 40 prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl. the abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with 1 prolene with the more running suture taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. the subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 20 vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. the patient was then turned over to the neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened. the patient was then transferred to the pacu in stable condition with spontaneous respirations having tolerated the procedure well.,Neurology
85,reason for referral the patient is a 58yearold africanamerican righthanded female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by dr. x. she is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the early stages of a likely dementia and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse. a comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning. the patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results. relevant background information historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient. a summary of pertinent information is presented below. please refer to the patients medical chart for a more complete history. history of presenting problem the patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for hospital center for four years. she was dismissed from this position in september 2009 although she said that she is still under active status technically but is not able to work. she continues to receive some compensation through fmla hours.,Neurology
86,she said that she was told that she had three options to resign to apply for disability retirement and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from state services. she said that these 90 days are up around the end of november. she said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints. she said that they began as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctors note for any days off. she said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays. she described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time. she said that since september 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback. in july of this year she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time. following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have she was sent to a neuropsychologist dr.,Neurology
87,y ph.d. he completed a comprehensive independent medical evaluation on 08142009. she said that on 08272009 she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore. please note that we do not have copies of any of her workrelated correspondence. the patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was too derogatory. a copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation. to summarize the results indicated diagnostically the patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory executive functioning and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history. this suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined. it concluded that results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetesrelated executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy the patient deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing. the prognosis for improvement is not good although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other. following her dismissal the patient presented to her primary physician henry fein m.d. who referred her to dr.,Neurology
88,x for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits. his neurological examination on 09232009 was unremarkable. the patient scored 2030 on the minimental status exam missing one out of three words on recall but was able to do so with prompting. a repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure. imaging studies mri of the brain on 09142009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions. note that the mri was done with and without gadolinium contrast. current functioning the patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her. when asked about changes in cognitive functioning she denied noticing any decline in problem solving language or nonverbal skills. she also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems. she continues to independently perform all activities of daily living. she is in charge of the household finances has had no problems paying bills on time has had no difficulties with driving or accidents denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning. she reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention.,Neurology
89,she said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician. she said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application. other current symptoms include excessive fatigue. she reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991 but generally symptoms are under better control now but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia. she also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year. she said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot like dragging. dr. xs physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. she said that she occasionally bumps into objects but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body. muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip. other medical history the patient reported that her birth and development were normal. she denied any significant medical conditions during childhood.,Neurology
90,as mentioned she now has a history of fibromyalgia. she also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm. mri of the cspine 04022009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at c7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at c6c7. mri of the right shoulder on 06042009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon. as mentioned she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991. she thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control. she also has diabetes high blood pressure osteoarthritis tension headaches gerd carpal tunnel disease cholecystectomy in 1976 and ectopic pregnancy in 1974. her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007. she has some difficulty falling asleep but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night. she did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep. current medications novolog insulin pump metformin metoprolol amlodipine topamax lortab tramadol amitriptyline calcium plus vitamin d fluoxetine pantoprazole naprosyn fluticasone propionate and vitamin c. substance use the patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs. she drinks two to four cups of coffee per day. social history the patient was born and raised in north carolina.,Neurology

122,we have talked to her. she is very supportive. his only sister is also very supportive of him. he has lived in the abcd houses in the past. he has done poorly in some of them. mental status examination the patient appeared alert oriented to time place and person. his affect is flat. he talked about auditory hallucinations which are equivocal in nature. he is not homicidal in the hospital as he was when he was at home. his voice and speech are normal. he believes in telepathy. his memory appears intact and his intelligence is calculated as average. initial diagnoses axis i schizophrenia. axis ii deferred. axis iii history of diabetes mellitus obesity and chronic bronchitis. axis iv moderate. axis v gaf of 35 on admission. initial treatment and plan since the patient has been on high dosages of medications we will give him a holiday and a structured environment. we will put him on benzodiazepines and make a decision antipsychotic later. we will make sure that he is safe and that he addresses his medical needs well.,Neurology
123,history of present illness the patient is a 79yearold righthanded man who reports that approximately one and a half years ago he fell down while walking in the living room from the bedroom. at that time he reports both legs gave away on him and he fell. he reported that he had some lightheadedness just before he fell and was slightly confused but was aware of what was happening around him. he was able to get up shortly after falling and according to the patient and his son subsequently returned back to normal. he was then well until the 3rd of july 2008 when his legs again gave way on him. this was not preceded by lightheadedness. he was rushed to the hospital and was found to have pneumonia and the fall was blamed on the pneumonia. he started using a walker from that time prior to that he was able to walk approximately two miles per day. he again had a fall in august of 2008 after his legs gave way. again there was no lightheadedness associated with this. he was again found to have pneumonia and again was admitted to hospital after which he went to rehabilitation and was able to use his walker again after this. he did not however return to the prejuly baseline. in october of 2008 after another fall he was found to have pneumonia again and shingles. he is currently in a chronic rehabilitation unit.,Neurology
124,he cannot use a walker and uses a wheelchair for everything. he states that his hands have been numb involving all the fingers of both hands for the past three weeks. he is also losing muscle bulk in his hands and has noticed some general weakness of his hands. he does however note that strength in his hands has not been normal since july 2008 but it is clearly getting worse. he has been aware of some fasciculations in his legs starting in august 2008 these are present both in the lower legs and the thighs. he does not report any cramps problems with swallowing or problems with breathing. he reports that he has had constipation alternating with diarrhea although there has been no loss of control of either his bowel or bladder. he has had some problems with blood pressure drops and does feel presyncopal when he stands. he also reports that he has no feeling in his feet and that his feet feel like sponges. this has been present for about nine months. he has also lost joint position sense in his feet for approximately nine months. past medical history pneumonia. he has had recurrent episodes of pneumonia which started at approximately age 20. these have been treated repeatedly over the years and on average he has tended to have an episode of pneumonia once every five years although this has been far more frequent in the past year. he is usually treated with antibiotics and then discharged.,Neurology
125,there is no known history of bronchiectasis inherited lung disease or another chronic pulmonary cause for the repeated pneumonia. he has had a catheter placed for urinary retention his urologist has told him that he thinks that this may be due to prostate enlargement. the patient does not have any history of diabetes and does not report any other medical problems. he has lost approximately 18 pounds in the past month. he had an appendectomy in the 1940s. he had an ankle resection in 1975. social history the patient stopped smoking 27 years ago he smoked approximately two packs a day with combined cigarettes and cigars. he has not smoked for the past 27 years. he hardly ever uses alcohol. he is currently retired. family history there is no family history of neuropathy pes cavus foot deformities or neuromuscular diseases. his aunt has a history of type ii diabetes. current medications fludrocortisone 0.1 mg p.o. q.d. midodrine 5 mg p.o. q.i.d. cymbalta 30 mg p.o. per day prilosec 20 mg p.o. per day lortab 10 mg p.o. per day amoxil 500 mg p.o. per day vitamin b12 1000 mcg weekly vitamin d 1000 units per day metamucil p.r.n. entericcoated aspirin once a day colace 200 mg p.o. q.d. senokot three tablets p.o. p.r.n. reglan 10 mg p.o. q.6h. xanax 0.25 mg p.o. q.8h. p.r.n. ambien 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. and dilaudid 2 mg tablets p.o. q.3h. p.r.n. protonix 40 mg per day and megace 400 mg per day.,Neurology
126,allergies he has no medication or food allergies. review of systems please see the health questionnaire and clinical notes from today. general physical examination vital signs bp was 13760 p was 89 and his weight could not be measured because he was in a wheelchair. his pain score was 0. appearance no acute distress. he is pleasant and wellgroomed. heent atraumatic normocephalic. no carotid bruits appreciated. lungs there were few coarse crackles in both lung bases. cardiovascular revealed a normal first and second heart sound with no third or fourth heart sound and no murmurs. the pulse was regular and of normal volume. abdomen soft with no masses and normal bowel sounds. there were no carotid bruits. extremities no contractures appreciated. neurological exam mse his orientation language calculations 1007 tests were all normal. there was atrophy and fasciculations in both the arms and legs. cranial nerves cranial nerve examination was normal with the exception that there was some mild atrophy of his tongue and possible fasciculations. his palatal movement was normal and gag reflex was normal. motor strength was decreased in all muscle groups as follows deltoid 44 biceps 44 triceps 55 wrist extensors 44 finger extensors 44 finger flexors 44 interossei 44 hip flexors 44 hip extensors 44 knee extensors 44 and knee flexors 44. foot dorsiflexion plantar flexion eversion toe extension and toe flexion was all 0 to 1. there was atrophy in both hands and general atrophy of the lower limb muscles.,Neurology
127,the feet were both cold and showed dystrophic features. fasciculations were present mainly in the hands. there was evidence of dysmetria and past pointing in the left hand. reflexes reflexes were 0 in all sites in the arms and legs. the jaw reflex was 2. vibration was severely decreased at the elbow and wrist and was absent in the fingers. vibration was absent in the toes and ankle bilaterally and was severely decreased at the knee. joint position sense was absent in the toes and severely decreased in the fingers. pin perception was absent in the feet and was decreased to the upper thighs. pin was decreased or absent in the fingers and decreased above the elbows. the same distribution of sensory loss was found with monofilament testing. coordination coordination was barely normal in the right hand. rapid alternating movements were decreased in the left hand greater than the right hand. the patient was unable to stand and therefore gait rombergs test and balance could not be assessed. diagnostic studies previous diagnostic studies and patient reports. there were extensive patient reports all of which were reviewed. a previous xray study of the lateral chest performed in october 2008 showed poor inspiration with basilar atelectasis and an infiltrate. an xray of the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine showed some evidence of lumbar spinal stenosis.,Neurology
128,a cta of the neck with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed minor stenosis in the left carotid a mild hard and soft plaque in the right carotid with approximately 55 stenosis. the posterior circulation showed a slightly dominant right vertebral artery with no stenosis. there was no significant stenosis but there was minor extracranial stenosis noted. an mri of the brain with and without contrast performed in november 2008 showed no evidence of an acute infarct major vascular occlusion and no abnormal enhancement with gadolinium administration. there was also no significant sinusitis or mastoiditis. this was an essentially normal brain mri. a cbc performed in january 2009 showed an elevated white cell count of 11.3 a low red cell count of 3.43 elevated mch of 32.4 and the rest of the study was normal. an electrolyte study performed in january 2009 showed a sodium which was low at 127 a calcium which was low at 8.3 and a low protein of 5.2 and albumin of 3.1. the glucose was 86. tsh performed in january 2009 was 1.57 which is within the normal range. vitamin b12 was greater than a 1000 which is normal and the folate was 18.2 which was normal. a myocardial stress study performed in december 2008 showed normal myocardial perfusion with persantine cardiolite spect. the ecg was nondiagnostic. there was normal regional wall motion of the left ventricle. the left ventricular ejection fraction was 68 which is within the normal range for males.,Neurology
129,a ct of the lumbar spine without contrast performed in december 2008 showed a broadbased disc bulge at l1l2 l2l3 l3l4 and l4l5. at l5s1 in addition to the broadbased disc bulge there was also an osteophyte complex and evidence of flavum hypertrophy without canal stenosis. there was severe bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at l5s1 and moderate neural foraminal stenosis at l1l4. an echocardiogram was performed in november 2008 and showed mild left atrial enlargement normal left ventricular systolic function mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy scleral degenerative changes in the aortic and mitral apparatus mild mitral regurgitation mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation. diagnostic impression the patient presents with a severe neuropathy with marked large fiber sensory as well as motor findings. he is diffusely weak as well as atrophic in all muscle groups both in his upper and lower extremities although he is disproportionately weak in his lower extremities. his proprioceptive and vibratory loss is severe in both the distal upper and lower extremities signifying that he either has a severe sensory neuropathy or has involvement of the dorsal root ganglia. according to the history which was carefully checked the initial onset of these symptoms goes back one and a half years although there has only been significant progression in his condition since july 2008.,Neurology
130,as indicated below further diagnostic studies including a detailed nerve conduction and emg test today showed evidence of a severe sensory motor and axonal neuropathy and in addition there was evidence of a diffuse polyradiculopathy. there was no involvement of the tongue on emg. the laboratory testing as indicated below failed to show a specific cause for the neuropathy. we are still however waiting for the paraneoplastic antibodies which were send out lab to the mayo clinic. this type of very severe sensorimotor neuropathy with significant proprioceptive loss may be seen in several conditions including peripheral nerve vasculitis due to a variety of disorders such as sle sjogrens rheumatoid arthritis and mixed connective tissue disease. in addition it may also be seen with certain toxins particularly chemotherapeutic agents. the patient did not receive any of these. it may also be seen as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome. although the patient does not have any specific clinical symptoms of a cancer it is noted that he has had an 18pound weight loss in the past month and does have a remote history of smoking. we have requested that he obtain a ct of his chest abdomen and pelvis while he is in acute rehabilitation. the verbal reports of these possibly did not show any evidence of a cancer. we did also request that he obtain a gallium scan to see if there was any evidence of an unsuspected neoplasm.,Neurology
131,the patient did undergo a nerve and muscle biopsy this was a radial nerve and biceps muscle biopsy from the left arm. this showed evidence of severe axonal loss. there was no evidence of a vasculitis. the vessels did show some mild intimal changes that would be consistent with atherosclerosis. there were a few perivascular changes however there was no clear evidence of a necrotizing vasculitis even on multiple sections. the muscle biopsy showed severe muscle fiber atrophy with evidence of fiber grouping. again there was no evidence of inflammation or vasculitis. evaluation so far has also shown no evidence of an amyloid neuropathy no evidence of a monoclonal gammopathy of sarcoidosis and again there is no past history of a significant toxin or infective cause for the neuropathy. specifically there is no history of hiv exposure. we would await the results of the gallium scan and of the paraneoplastic antibodies to see if these are helpful in making a diagnosis. at this point because of the severity and the axonal nature of the neuropathy there is no specific therapy that will reverse the course of the illness unless we find a specific etiology that can be stopped or reversed. i have discussed these issues at length with the patient and with his son. we also addressed whether or not there might be a previously undiagnosed inherited neuropathy. i think this is unlikely given the short history and the rapid progression of the disorder.,Neurology
132,there is also no family history that we can detect a neuropathy and the patient does not have the typical phenotype for a chronic inherited neuropathy such as charcotmarietooth disease type 2. however since i have only seen the patient on one occasion and do not know what his previous examination showed two years ago i cannot be certain that there may not have been the presence of a neuropathy preceding this. plan nerve conduction and emg will be performed today. the results were indicated above. the following laboratory studies were requested including electrolytes cbc thyroid function tests b12 ana creactive protein complement cryoglobulins doublestranded dna antibodies folate level hemoglobin a1c immunofixation electrophoresis panca canca protein electrophoresis rheumatoid factor paraneoplastic antibody studies requested from the mayo clinic b12. these studies showed minor changes which included a low sodium level of 129 as previously noted a low creatinine of 0.74 low calcium of 8.6 low total protein of 5.7. the b12 was greater than 2000. the immunoelectrophoresis ana doublestranded dna anca hemoglobin a1c folate cryoglobulins complement creactive protein were all normal or negative. the b12 level was greater than 2000. liver function tests were normal. the glucose was 90. esr was 10. hemoglobin a1c was 5.5. a left radial sensory and left biceps biopsy were requested and have been performed and interpreted as indicated above. ct of chest abdomen and pelvis. whole body gallium scan for evidence of an underlying neoplasm.,Neurology
133,the patient will go to the rehabilitation facility for acute rehabilitation and training. we have not made any changes to his medication. he does have some mild orthostatic changes however he is adequately controlled with midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times a day as needed up to 5 mg four times a day. usually he uses a lower dose of 2.5 three times a day to 5 mg three times a day. followup will be as determined by the family.,Neurology
134,reason for neurological consultation muscle twitching clumsiness progressive pain syndrome and gait disturbance. history of present illness the patient is a 62yearold africanamerican male with a significant past medical history of diabetes hypertension previous stroke in 2002 with minimal residual rightsided weakness as well as two mis status post pacemaker insertion who first presented with numbness in his lower extremities in 2001. he states that since that time these symptoms have been progressive and now involving his legs above his knees as well as his hands. more recently he describes a burning sensation along with numbness. this has become a particular problem and of all the problems he has he feels that pain is his primary concern. over the last six months he has noticed that he cannot feel hot objects in his hands and that objects slip out of his hands. he denies any weakness per se just clumsiness and decreased sensation. he has also been complaining of brief muscle jerks which occur in both hands and his shoulders. this has been a fairly longstanding problem and again has become more prevalent recently. he does not have any tremor. he denies any neck pain. he walks with the aid of a walker because of unsteadiness with gait. recently he has tried gabapentin but this was not effective for pain control. oxycodone helps somewhat and gives him at least three hours pain relief. because of the pain he has significant problems with fractured sleep.,Neurology
135,he states he has not had a good nights sleep in many years. about six months ago after an mi and pacemaker insertion he was transferred to a nursing facility. at that facility his insulin was stopped. since then he has only been on oral medication for his diabetes. he denies any back pain neck pain change in bowel or bladder function or specific injury predating these symptoms. past medical history diabetes hypertension coronary artery disease stroke arthritis gerd and headaches. medications trazodone simvastatin hydrochlorothiazide prevacid lisinopril glipizide and gabapentin. family history discussed above and documented on the chart. social history discussed above and documented on the chart. he does not smoke. he lives in a senior citizens building with daily nursing aids. he previously was a security guard but is currently on disability. review of systems discussed above and documented on the chart. physical examination on examination blood pressure 15080 pulse of 80 respiratory rate 22 and weight 360 pounds. pain scale 710. a full general and neurological examination was performed on the patient and is documented on the chart. the patient is obese with significant ankle edema. neurological examination reveals normal cognitive exam and normal cranial nerve examination. motor examination reveals mild atrophy in bilateral fdis but still has a strong grip. individual muscle strength is close to normal with only subtle weakness found in ankle plantar and dorsiflexion. tone and bulk are normal.,Neurology
136,sensory examination reveals a severe decrease to all modalities in his lower extremities from just above the knees distally. he has no vibration sense at his knees. similarly there is decrease to all sensory modalities in his both upper extremities from just above the wrist distally. the only reflexes i could obtain with trace reflexes in his biceps. remaining reflexes were unelicitable. no babinski. the patient walks normally with the aid of a cane. he has severe sensory ataxia with inability to walk unaided. positive romberg with eyes open and closed. impression and plan probable painful diabetic neuropathy. symptoms are predominantly sensory and severely dysfunctioning with the patient having inability to ambulate independently as well as difficulty with grip and temperature differentiation in his upper extremities. he has relative preservation of motor function. because these symptoms are progressive and by report he came off his insulin suggesting somewhat mild diabetes i would like to rule out other causes of progressive neuropathy. he has history of myoclonic jerks. i did not see any on my examination today and i feel that these are benign and probably secondary to his severe insomnia which he states is secondary to the painful neuropathy. i would like to rule out other causes such as hepatic encephalopathy. i have recommended the following emgnerve conduction study to assess severity of neuropathy and to characterize neuropathy.,Neurology
137,blood work looking for other causes of neuropathy and myoclonus to include cbc cmp tsh lft b12 rpr esr lyme titer and hba1c and ammonia level. neurontin and oxycodone have not been effective and i have recommended cymbalta starting at 30 mg q.d. for five days and then increasing to 60 mg q.d. side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient. i have explained to him that progression of diabetic neuropathy is closely related to diabetic control and i have recommended tight diabetic control. i will see him at followup at the emg.,Neurology
138,neurological examination at present the patient is awake alert and fully oriented. there is no evidence of cognitive or language dysfunction. cranial nerves visual fields are full. funduscopic examination is normal. extraocular movements full. pupils equal round react to light. there is no evidence of nystagmus noted. fifth nerve function is normal. there is no facial asymmetry noted. lower cranial nerves are normal. manual motor testing reveals good tone and bulk throughout. there is no evidence of pronator drift or decreased fine finger movements. muscle strength is 55 throughout. deep tendon reflexes are 2 throughout with downgoing toes. sensory examination is intact to all modalities including stereognosis graphesthesia. testing of station and gait the patient is able to walk toeheel and tandem walk. fingertonose and heeltoshin moves are normal. romberg sign negative. i appreciate no carotid bruits or cardiac murmurs. noncontrast ct scan of the head shows no evidence of acute infarction hemorrhage or extraaxial collection.,Neurology
139,problems and issues headaches nausea and dizziness consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and motrin for abortive treatment. some degree of peripheral neuropathy consistent with diabetic neuropathy encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily. history of present illness the patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches tunnel vision and dizziness. i obtained and documented a full history and physical examination. i reviewed the new patient questionnaire which she completed prior to her arrival today. i also reviewed the results of tests which she had brought with her. briefly she is a 60yearold woman initially from ukraine who had headaches since age 25. she recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent. they were pulsating. she was given papaverine which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms. after six months of taking papaverine she no longer had any headaches. in 2004 her headaches returned. she also noted that she had zigzag lines in her vision. sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions. she had photophobia and dizziness which was mostly lightheadedness. on one occasion she almost had a syncope. again she has started taking russian medications which did help her. the dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week. they last two hours since she takes papaverine which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes.,Neurology

149,reason for visit the patient is a 76yearold man referred for neurological consultation by dr. x. the patient is companied to clinic today by his wife and daughter. he provides a small portion of his history however his family provides virtually all of it. history of present illness he has trouble with walking and balance with bladder control and with thinking and memory. when i asked him to provide me detail he could not tell me much more than the fact that he has trouble with his walking and that he has trouble with his bladder. he is vaguely aware that he has trouble with his memory. according to his family he has had difficulty with his gait for at least three or four years. at first they thought it was weakness and because of he was on the ground for example gardening he was not able to get up by himself. they did try stopping the statin that he was taking at that time but because there was no improvement over two weeks they resumed the statin. as time progressed he developed more and more difficulty. he started to shuffle. he started using a cane about two and a half years ago and has used a walker with wheels in the front since july of 2006. at this point he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out of the seat. he frequently tends to lean backwards or sideways when sitting.,Neurology
150,he frequently if not always has trouble getting in or out a car always shuffles or scuffs his feet always has trouble turning or changing direction always has trouble with uneven surfaces or curbs and always has to hold on to someone or something when walking. he has not fallen in the last month. he did fall earlier but there seemed to be fewer opportunities for him to fall. his family has recently purchased a lightweight wheelchair to use if he is traveling long distances. he has no stairs in his home however his family indicates that he would not be able to take stairs. his handwriting has become smaller and shakier. in regard to the bladder he states i wet the bed. in talking with his family it seems as if he has no warning that he needs to empty his bladder. he was diagnosed with a small bladder tumor in 2005. this was treated by dr. y. dr. x does not think that the bladder tumor has anything to do with the patients urinary incontinence. the patient has worn a pad or undergarment for at least one to one and a half years. his wife states that they go through two or three of them per day. he has been placed on medications however they have not helped. he has no headaches or sensation of head fullness. in regard to the thinking and memory at first he seemed forgetful and had trouble with dates.,Neurology
151,now he seems less spontaneous and his family states he seems to have trouble expressing himself. his wife took over his medications about two years ago. she stopped his driving about three years ago. she discovered that his license had been expired for about a year and she was concerned enough at that time that she told him he could drive no more. apparently he did not object. at this point he frequently has trouble with memory orientation and everyday problems solving at home. he needs coaching for his daily activities such as reminders to brush his teeth put on his clothes and so forth. he is a retired office machine repairman. he is currently up and active about 12 hours a day and sleeping or lying down about 12 hours per day. he has not had pt or ot and has not been treated with medications for parkinsons disease or alzheimers disease. he has been treated for the bladder. he has not had lumbar puncture. past medical history and review of all 14 systems from the form they completed for this visit that i reviewed with them is negative with the exception that he has had hypertension since 1985 hypercholesterolemia since 1997 and diabetes since 1998. the bladder tumor was discovered in 2005 and was treated noninvasively. he has lost weight from about 200 pounds to 180 pounds over the last two or three years.,Neurology
152,he had a period of depression in 1999 and was on prozac for a while but this was then stopped. he used to drink a significant amount of alcohol. this was problematic enough that his wife was concerned. she states he stopped when she retired and she was at home all day. social history he quit smoking in 1968. his current weight is 183 pounds. his tallest height is 5 feet 10 inches. family history his grandfather had arthritis. his father had parkinsons disease. his mother had heart disease and a sister has diabetes. he does not have a living will and indicates he would wish his wife to make decisions for him if he could not make them for himself. review of hydrocephalus risk factors none. allergies none. medications metformin 500 mg three times a day lipitor 10 mg per day lisinopril 20 mg per day metoprolol 50 mg per day uroxatral 10 mg per day detrol la 4 mg per day and aspirin 81 mg per day. physical exam on examination today this is a pleasant 76yearold man who is guided back from the clinic waiting area walking with his walker. he is well developed well nourished and kempt. vital signs his weight is 180 pounds. head the head is normocephalic and atraumatic. the head circumference is 59 cm which is the 7590th percentile for an adult man whose height is 178 cm. spine the spine is straight and not tender. i can easily palpate the spinous processes.,Neurology
153,there is no scoliosis. skin no neurocutaneous stigmata. cardiovascular examination no carotid or vertebral bruits. mental status assessed for orientation recent and remote memory attention span concentration language and fund of knowledge. the minimental state exam score was 1730. he did not know the year season or day of the week nor did he know the building or specialty or the floor. there was a tendency for perseveration during the evaluation. he could not copy the diagram of intersecting pentagons. cranial nerve exam no evidence of papilledema. the pupillary light reflex is intact as are extraocular movements without nystagmus facial expression and sensation hearing head turning tongue and palate movement. motor exam normal bulk and strength but the tone is marked by significant paratonia. there is no atrophy fasciculations or drift. there is tremulousness of the outstretched hands. sensory exam is difficult to interpret. either he does not understand the test or he is mostly guessing. cerebellar exam is intact for fingertonose heeltoknee and rapid alternating movement tests. there is no dysarthria. reflexes trace in the arms 2 at the knees and 0 at the ankles. it is not certain whether there is a babinski sign or simply withdrawal. gait assessed using the tinetti assessment tool that shows a balance score of 71016 and a gait score of 2512 for a total score of 91528 which is significantly impaired. review of xrays i personally reviewed the mri scan of the brain from december 11 2007 at advanced radiology.,Neurology
154,it shows the ventricles are enlarged with a frontal horn span of 5.0 cm. the 3rd ventricle contour is flat. the span is enlarged at 12 mm. the sylvian aqueduct is patent. there is a pulsation artifact. the corpus callosum is effaced. there are extensive t2 signal abnormalities that are confluent in the corona radiata. there are also scattered t2 abnormalities in the basal ganglia. there is a suggestion of hippocampal atrophy. there is also a suggestion of vermian atrophy. assessment the patient has a clinical syndrome that raises the question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. his examination today is notable for moderatetosevere dementia and moderatetosevere gait impairment. his mri scan raises the question of hydrocephalus however is also consistent with cerebral small vessel disease. problemsdiagnoses possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 331.5. probable cerebral smallvessel disease 290.40 438. gait impairment 781.2. urinary urgency and incontinence 788.33. dementia. hypertension. hypercholesterolemia.,Neurology
155,history of present illness the patient is a 55yearold gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness. he has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem. to the best of his recollection he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg. he describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe. since that time he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks. he has mild tingling and numbness in his toes but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness. he has chronic mild back pain but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed. he has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year. this dissipated about two months ago. he does not think that his left leg is weak. he does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence. there is no radicular pain. he does not think that the problem is progressive meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. he first sought medical attention for this problem in october. he then saw you a couple of months later. he has undergone an emg and nerve conduction studies. unfortunately he cannot undergo an mri of his spine because he has an ear implant.,Neurology
156,he has had a ct scan that shows degenerative changes but nothing obviously abnormal. in addition the patient has hyperckemia. he tells me that he has had an elevated ck prior to starting taking stat medications although this is not entirely clear to me. he thinks that he is not taking lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his ck was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it. once it was started it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped. he then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since lipitor has been stopped his ck apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s. i do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient but he seems to be up to speed on this. more recently he has been started taking zetia. he does not have any proximal weakness. he denies any myalgias. past medical history he has coronary artery disease and has received five stents. he has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. he states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test. he believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing. he does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it. he has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury.,Neurology
157,he also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon. current medications he takes amlodipine diovan zetia hydrochlorothiazide lovaza fish oil niaspan aspirin and chantix. allergies he has no known drug allergies. social history he lives with his wife. he works at shepherd pratt doing network engineering. he smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting. he drinks four alcoholic beverages per night. prior to that he drank significantly more. he denies illicit drug use. he was athletic growing up. family history his mother died of complications from heart disease. his father died of heart disease in his 40s. he has two living brothers. one of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history. the other is apparently healthy. he has one healthy child. his maternal uncles apparently had polio. when i asked him to tell me further details about this he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg. he is fairly certain that they had polio. he is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions. review of systems he has occasional tinnitus. he has difficulty sleeping. otherwise a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. this is documented in the handwritten notes from todays visit. physical examination vital signs,Neurology
158,history neurologic consultation was requested to assess and assist with her seizure medication. the patient is a 3year 3 months old girl with refractory epilepsy. she had been previously followed by xyz but has been under the care of the ucsf epilepsy program and recently by dr. y. i reviewed her pertinent previous neurology evaluations at chcc and also interviewed mom. the patient had seizure breakthrough in august 2007 which requires inpatient admission thanksgiving and then after that time had seizures every other day uptodate early december. she remained seizurefree until 12252007 when she had a breakthrough seizure at home treated with diastat. she presented to our er today with prolonged convulsive seizure despite receiving 20 mg of diastat at home. mom documented 103 temperature at home. in the er this was 101 to 102 degrees fahrenheit. i reviewed the er notes. at 0754 hours she was having intermittent generalized tonicclonic seizures despite receiving a total of 1.5 mg of lorazepam x5. ucsf fellow was contacted. she was given additional fosphenytoin and had a total dose of 15 mgkg administered. vital weight was 27. seizures apparently had stopped. the valproic acid level obtained at 0835 hours was 79. according to mom her last dose was at 6 p.m. and she did not receive her morning dose. other labs slightly showed leukocytosis with white blood cell count 21 000 and normal cmp. previous workup here showed an eeg on 2005 which showed a left posterior focus.,Neurology
159,mri on june 2007 and january 2005 were within normal limits. mom describes the following seizure types eye blinking with unresponsiveness. staring off to one side. focal motor activity in one arm and recently generalized tonic seizure. she also said that she was supposed to see dr. y this friday but had postponed it to some subsequent time when results of genetic testing would be available. she was being to physicians care as dr. z had previously being following her last ucsf. she had failed most of the first and second line antiepileptic drugs. these include keppra lamictal trileptal phenytoin and phenobarbital. these are elicited to allergies but she has not had any true allergic reactions to these. actually it has resulted in an allergic reaction resulting in rash and hypotension. she also had been treated with clobazam. her best control is with her current regimen of valproic acid and tranxene. other attempts to taper topamax but this resulted increased seizures. she also has oligohidrosis during this summertime. current medications include diastat 20 mg topamax 25 mg b.i.d. which is 3.3 per kilo per day tranxene 15 mg b.i.d. depakote 125 mg t.i.d. which is 25 per kilo per day. physical examination vital signs weight 15 kg. general the patient was awake she appeared sedated and postictal. neck supple. neurological she had a few brief myoclonic jerks of her legs during drowsiness but otherwise no overt seizure no seizure activity nor involuntary movements were observed.,Neurology
160,she was able to follow commands such as when i request that she gave mom a kiss. she acknowledged her doll. left fundus is sharp. she resisted the rest of the exam. there was no obvious lateralized findings. assessment status epilepticus resolved. triggered by a febrile illness possibly viral. refractory remote symptomatic partial epilepsy. impression i discussed the maximizing depakote to mom and she concurred. i recommend increasing her maintenance dose to one in the morning one in the day and two at bedtime. for today she did give an iv depacon 250 mg and the above dosage can be continued iv until she is taking p.o. dr. x agreed with the changes and orders were written for this. she can continue her current doses of topamax and tranxene. this can be given by ng if needed. topamax can be potentially increased to 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at night. i will be available as needed during the rest of her hospitalization. mom will call contact dr. y an update him about the recent changes.,Neurology
161,diagnoses juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. recent generalized tonicclonic seizure. medications lamictal 250 mg b.i.d. depoprovera. interim history the patient returns for followup. since last consultation she has tolerated lamictal well but she has had a recurrence of her myoclonic jerking. she has not had a generalized seizure. she is very concerned that this will occur. most of the myoclonus is in the mornings. recent eeg did show polyspike and slow wave complexes bilaterally more prominent on the left. she states that she has been very compliant with the medications and is getting a good amount of sleep. she continues to drive. social history and review of systems are discussed above and documented on the chart. physical examination vital signs are normal. pupils are equal and reactive to light. extraocular movements are intact. there is no nystagmus. visual fields are full. demeanor is normal. facial sensation and symmetry is normal. no myoclonic jerks noted during this examination. no myoclonic jerks provoked by tapping on her upper extremity muscles. negative orbit. deep tendon reflexes are 2 and symmetric. gait is normal. tandem gait is normal. romberg negative. impression and plan recurrence of early morning myoclonus despite high levels of lamictal. she is tolerating the medication well and has not had a generalized tonicclonic seizure. she is concerned that this is a precursor for another generalized seizure. she states that she is compliant with her medications and has had a normal sleepwake cycle.,Neurology
162,looking back through her notes she initially responded very well to keppra but did have a breakthrough seizure on keppra. this was thought secondary to severe insomnia when her baby was very young. because she tolerated the medication well and it was at least partially affective i have recommended adding keppra 500 mg b.i.d. side effect profile of this medication was discussed with the patient. i will see in followup in three months.,Neurology
163,social history family history and past medical history reviewed. there are no changes otherwise. review of systems fatigue pain difficulty with sleep mood fluctuations low stamina mild urgency frequency and hesitancy preponderance of lack of stamina preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder. examination the patient is alert and oriented. extraocular movements are full. the face is symmetric. the uvula is midline. speech has normal prosody. today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder. in the lower extremities iliopsoas quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior are full. the gait is narrow based and noncircumductive. rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally. the gait does not have significant slapping characteristics. sensory examination is largely unremarkable. heart lungs and abdomen are within normal limits. impression mr. abc is doing about the same. we discussed the issue of adherence to copaxone. in order to facilitate this i would like him to take copaxone every other day but on a regular rhythm. his wife continues to inject him. he has not been able to start himself on the injections. greater than 50 of this 40minute appointment was devoted to counseling.,Neurology
164,subsequently the patient developed a moderately severe depression. she was tried on various medications which caused sweating nightmares and perhaps other side effects. she was finally put on effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s. and has done fairly well although she still has significant depression. her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia. there is no history of memory loss. there is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches. the patients complaints according to the daughter include not wanted to go out in public shamed regarding her appearance 25pound weight loss over the past year eating poorly not doing things unless asked hiding food to prevent having to eat it nervousness and not taking a shower. she has no focal neurologic deficits. she does complain of constipation. she has severe sleep maintenance insomnia and often sleeps only 2 hours before awakening frequently for the rest of the night. the patient was apparently visiting her daughter in northern california in december 2003. she was taken to her daughters primary care physician. she underwent vitamin b12 level rpr t4 and tsh all of which were normal. on 051504 the patient underwent mri scan of the brain. i reviewed the scan in the office today. this shows moderate cortical and central atrophy and also shows mildtomoderate deep white matter ischemic changes. past medical history the patient has generally been in reasonably good physical health.,Neurology

166,history of present illness the patient is a 63yearold lefthanded gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms. i asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems. he first mentioned that he has neck pain. he states that he has had this for at least 15 years. it is worse with movement. it has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years. it is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality. he also endorses a history of gait instability. this has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening. he describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and walks like a duck. he has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. he also describes that he has numbness in his feet. when i asked him to describe this in more detail the numbness is actually restricted to his toes. left is slightly more affected than the right. he denies any tingling or paresthesias. he also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands. he thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands. this has also been occurring for the past one to two years. he has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him. he also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands.,Neurology
167,he does have a history of chronic low back pain. at the end of the visit when i asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome. he did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking. when i asked him to describe this further he states that he experiences a general exhaustion. he basically lays in bed all day everyday. i asked him if he was depressed he states that he is treated for depression. he is unsure if this is optimally treated. as i just mentioned he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities. he does not think that he is necessarily sad. his appetite is good. he has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. when i took his history i noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past. i asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at johns hopkins a couple of years ago. he states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. when i asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms he states that he saw dr. x several years ago.,Neurology
168,he believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes. he told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after dr. y referred him for this evaluation. he also saw dr. z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago. he reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time. past medical history he has had diabetes for five years. he also has had hypercholesterolemia. he has had crohns disease for 25 or 30 years. he has had a colostomy for four years. he has arthritis which is reportedly related to the crohns disease. he has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement. he has depression. he had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago. current medications he takes actos ambien baby aspirin coreg entocort folic acid flomax iron lexapro 20 mg q.h.s. lipitor pentasa plavix protonix toprol celebrex and zetia. allergies he states that imuran caused him to develop tachycardia. social history he previously worked with pipeline work but has been on disability for five years. he is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability. he has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit about 20 years ago. he denies alcohol or illicit drug use. he lives with his wife. he does not really have any hobbies.,Neurology
169,family history his father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49. his mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure. he has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago. he has another sister with diabetes. he has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia. he is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders. review of systems he has dyspnea on exertion. he states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation. he has occasional night sweats. his hearing is poor. he occasionally develops bloody stools which he attributes to his crohns disease. he also was diagnosed with sleep apnea. he does not wear his cpap machine on a regular basis. he has a history of anemia. otherwise a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. this is documented in the handwritten notes from todays visit. physical examination vital signs blood pressure 16086 hr 100 rr 16 wt 211 pounds pain 310 general appearance he is well appearing in no acute distress. he has somewhat of a flat affect. cardiovascular he has a regular rhythm without murmurs gallops or rubs. there are no carotid bruits. chest the lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. skin there are no rashes or lesions. musculoskeletal he has no joint deformities or scoliosis. neurological examination mental status his speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. he is alert and oriented to name place and date.,Neurology
170,attention concentration and fund of knowledge are intact. he has 33 object registration and 13 recall in 5 minutes. cranial nerves pupils are equal round and reactive to light and accommodation. visual fields are full. optic discs are normal. extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. facial sensation is normal. there is no facial jaw palate or tongue weakness. hearing is grossly intact. shoulder shrug is full. motor he has normal muscle bulk and tone. there is no atrophy. he has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally. manual muscle testing reveals mrc grade 55 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. there is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. sensory he has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe. this is diminished at the right toe. joint position sense is intact. there is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally. pinprick is intact. romberg is absent. there is no spinal sensory level. coordination this is intact by fingernosefinger or heeltoshin testing. he does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms. deep tendon reflexes they are 2 at the biceps triceps brachioradialis patellas and ankles. plantar reflexes are flexor. there is no ankle clonus finger flexors or hoffmans signs. he has crossed adductors bilaterally. gait and stance he has a slightly widebased gait. he has some difficulty with toe walking but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk.,Neurology

172,he really is most concerned about the fatigue and i think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea. whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen. recommendations i scheduled him for repeat emg and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy. i will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although i am confident in dr. zs opinion that there is no surgical indication. i gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain. i believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression. it may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications but i will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist. the patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion. he does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled. he states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well. this should also be addressed.,Neurology

260,reason for visit this is a new patient evaluation for mr. a. there is a malignant meningioma. he is referred by dr. x. history of present illness he said he has had two surgeries in 0706 followed by radiation and then again in 0807. he then had a problem with seizures hemiparesis has been to the hospital developed cdiff and is in the nursing home currently. he is unable to stand at the moment. he is unable to care for himself. i reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history. medications keppra 1500 twice a day and decadron 6 mg four times a day. his other medicines include oxycodone an aspirin a day prilosec dilantin 300 a day and flagyl. findings on examination he is lying on the stretcher. he has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation. he is unable to lift his right arm or right leg. he has an expressive dysphasia and confusion. i reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 1007 end of 1007 as well as the current mri he had last week. this shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema. this is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis. assessmentplan in summary mr. a has significant disability and is not independent currently.,Neurology
261,i believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery. i do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor. given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given i believe that surgery would not be in his best interest. i discussed this both with him although it is not clear to me how much he understood as well as his family.,Neurology

268,history of present illness the patient is a 35yearold woman who reports that on the 30th of october 2008 she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic. i do not have the records from this hospital admission but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours. she was sitting up during the epidural. she did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural however she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time. she delivered on the 31st of october by cesarean section because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia. she also had a foley catheter placed at that time. on the 1st of november 2008 they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk. she was aware that she could not move her legs at all and then within a few days she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all. since that time there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg.,Neurology
269,she is not able to walk by herself and needs assistance to stand. she was discharged from hospital after the cesarean section on the 3rd of november. unfortunately we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge. she was then seen at abc hospital on november 05 she had an mri scan of her spine which showed no evidence of an abnormality specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma. she also had an emg study at that time by dr. x which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in december. at the present time she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs. she complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there. she has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal. she has no symptoms in her arms her bowel and bladder function is normal and her bulbar function is normal. there is no problem with her vision swallowing or respiratory function. past medical history unremarkable except as noted above. she has seasonal allergies. current medications gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d. centrum once a day and another multivitamin. allergies she has no medication allergies but does have seasonal allergies. family history there is a family history of diabetes and hypertension.,Neurology

272,joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left. coordination coordination for rapid alternating movements and fingertonose testing was normal. coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities. gait the patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or rombergs. there was no evidence of focal back tenderness. review of outside records i have reviewed the records from abc hospital including the letter from dr. y and the emg report dated 12172008 from dr. x. the emg report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately t6. the lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal however there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency. i do have the mri of lumbar spine report from 11062008 with and without contrast. this showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of l4l5 without disc herniation but was otherwise unremarkable. the patient brought a disc with a most recent mri study however we were unable to open this on our computers. the verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots. a doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. chest xray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine curve to the left but no evidence of other abnormalities.,Neurology
273,a ct pelvis study performed on november 07 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back posterior to l4 and l5 levels however there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities. we were able to obtain an update of the report from the mri of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12302008. the complete study included the cervical thoracic and lumbar spine. there was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in november. it was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities. impression the patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of october 2008 prior to her cesarean section. it appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function. she was severely weak in both lower extremities slightly worse on the right than the left. there has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of november 2008. her emg study from the end of december is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.,Neurology
274,the mri findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural. there had been no response to iv methylprednisolone given to her at abc. the issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both abc and by myself. the patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition. at the present time she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk. there is no evidence on her previous emg of a demyelinating neuropathy. recommendations the diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length. she is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain. she is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory. if she is able to walk she will need bilateral afos for her ankles to improve her overall mobility. i am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them. we discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin.,Neurology

292,chief complaint right shoulder pain. history the patient is a pleasant 31yearold righthanded white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 010102. she formerly worked for veterans home as a cna. she has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder. she tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in november 2002. she had ongoing pain and was evaluated by dr. x who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy. he also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms. he then referred her to abcd who did emg testing demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a c5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out. mri testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 121803. she finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by dr. x. she comes to me for impairment rating. she has no chronic health problems otherwise fevers chills or general malaise. she is not working. she is righthand dominant. she denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder. past medical history negative aside from above. family history noncontributory. social history please see above. review of systems negative aside from above. physical examination a pleasant age appropriate woman moderately overweight in no apparent distress.,Neurology
293,normal gait and station normal posture normal strength tone sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 45 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right. she has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows. she has 160 degrees of flexion 155 degrees of abduction 35 degrees of extension 25 degrees of adduction 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation. she has a positive impingement sign on the right. assessment right shoulder impingement syndrome right suprascapular neuropathy. discussion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on ama guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment fifth edition. the reason for this impairment is the incident of 010102. for her suprascapular neuropathy she is rated as a grade iv motor deficit which i rate as a 13 motor deficit. this is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16 which produces a 2 impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together 2 impairment of the upper extremity. for her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right. she has a 1 impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion. she has a 1 impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction. she has a 1 impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.,Neurology
294,she has a 1 impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension. there is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation. she has a 3 impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation. thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6 impairment of the upper extremity. this combines with the 2 impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8 impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5 impairment of the whole person based on the ama guide to the evaluation of permanent impairment fifth edition stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.,Neurology

304,the left lower extremity pain is in a left l4 and l5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. she denies any significant low back pain. no right lower extremity symptoms. no infectious symptoms whatsoever. no fever chills chest pain shortness of breath. no drainage from the wound. no difficulties with the incision. findings on examination ms. abc is a pleasant welldeveloped wellnourished female in no apparent distress. alert and oriented x 3. normocephalic atraumatic. respirations are normal and nonlabored. afebrile to touch. left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5 extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. gastrocsoleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. this has all been changed compared to preoperatively. motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. the incision is well healed. there is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. no drainage. radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at l4 and l5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. lumbar spine mri performed on 070307 is also reviewed. it demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at l4 and l5. there is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. assessment and plan ms.,Neurology
305,abc is doing relatively well status post l4 and l5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 070807. the case is significant for merely misdirected right l4 pedicle screw which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. i am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. however it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation no hardware shift and the mri demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. i do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. i would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. my recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. i have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. she is happy with this. i would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. she can go ahead and continue with requip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. i have also her referred to mrs. khan at physical medicine and rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. i will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. she knows that if she has any difficulties she may follow up with me sooner.,Neurology

348,however this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ich as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura. procedure in detail the patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team. appropriate central line as well as arterial line foley catheter ted and scds were placed. the patient was positioned supine with a threepoint mayfield head pin holder. her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed however through the same scalp scar the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly. the scalp was resected anteriorly. the subdural scar was noted and hemostasis was achieved using bovie cautery. the temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner and the titanium plating system was then exposed. the titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety. the bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers. the granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as bovie cautery. the bone flap was then removed using leksell rongeur and the underlying dura was inspected. it was quite full.,Neurology
349,the 40 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using highspeed drill in combination with leksell rongeur. the sphenoid wing was also resected using a highspeed drill as well as angled rongeur. hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax. the dura packup stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy. this was left in place. the microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure. using a 15 blade a new durotomy was then made. then the durotomy was carried out using metzenbaum scissors then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner placed anteriorly and this was done under the operating microscope. the underlying brain was quite edematous. along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface. thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered. the parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal. it was quite vascular. furthermore there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself. thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip. the overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened approximately 0.25 cm thick and it was also highly vascular and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology.,Neurology
350,furthermore sample of the temporal lobe was cultured. hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished. no attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure. once hemostasis was meticulously achieved the brain was inspected. it still was quite swollen known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain. however at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed. duragen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura. the bone flap was then repositioned using lorenz plating system. then a medium hemovac drain was placed in subdural space. temporalis muscle was approximated using 20 vicryl. the galea was then reapproximated using inverted 20 vicryl. the scalp was then reapproximated using staples. the head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion. she was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively and she followed commands briskly. the pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light. i accompanied her and transported her to the icu where i signed out to the icu attending.,Neurology

368,it shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. by my reading there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. this was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections. there is also substantial small vessel ischemic change. assessment mr. a has made some improvement since shunt surgery. problemsdiagnoses adult hydrocephalus 331.5. gait impairment 781.2. urinary incontinence and urgency 788.33. cognitive impairment 290.0. plan i had a long discussion with mr. a and his daughter. we are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because i believe i see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region i would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt. i do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan. mr. a asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. unfortunately i think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a drivers safety evaluation however occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test.,Neurology
369,i would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if i believe mr. a is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a drivers safety program without my recommendation however i think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. i also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test.,Neurology

377,referring diagnosis motor neuron disease. pertinent history and examination briefly the patient is an 83yearold woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year dysarthria weakness of her right arm cramps in her legs and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities. summary the right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity. the right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. the right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. the right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent. the right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist with proximal slowing. the distal amplitude was very reduced and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation. the right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow. the right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the edb with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee. the right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency. the left common peroneal response recorded from the edb showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing. the left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency. the minimum fwave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar fwave latency and the tibial fwave latency as indicated above.,Neurology
378,with repetitive nerve stimulation there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles. concentric needle emg studies were performed in the right lower extremity right upper extremity thoracic paraspinals and in the tongue. there was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue. in addition there was evidence of increased amplitude long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above. interpretation abnormal electrodiagnostic study. there is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments. there is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities. there is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. even despite the patients age the decrease in sensory responses is concerning and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. however the overall changes on the needle emg would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. the patient will return for further evaluation.,Neurology

384,history this is a digital eeg performed on a 75yearold male with seizures. background activity the background activity consists of a 8 hz to 9 hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. this rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. there are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 hz to 5 hz which suggests possible parkinsons. part of the eeg is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. there are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. at one point of time there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. activation procedures photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality. sleep patterns no sleep architecture was observed during this tracing. impression this awakealertdrowsy eeg is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region and due to the tremors. the slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities so a stroke subdural hematoma etc. should be ruled out. the tremor probably represents a parkinsons tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities so clinical correlation is recommended.,Neurology

473,the sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. from these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm a window of bone was removed. bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in siloxane suspension for later use. the bone flap was also left at the site for further use. dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. there was extensively aerated temporal bone. at this point dr. trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. the cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. once initial exposure was completed attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. the dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. then using diamond burs the internal auditory canal was dissected out. the bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. there was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. the dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. the tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. therefore dr.,Neurology
474,trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. with dissection he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. the eighth nerve was identified and transected. tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. the facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. it was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. the superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. at this point plane of dissection was again indistinct. the tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. the tumor was further debulked and thinned but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. the nerve could be stimulated but was quite splayed over the anterior face. further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve both proximally and distally. however the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated.,Neurology
475,however the tumor was then thinned using cusa down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. it was released from the brainstem ventrally. the tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. the facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes. overall the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. at this point dr. trask reinspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. the air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. a piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. next the dura was closed with duragen and duraseal. the bone flap and bone were then placed in the bone defect. postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 30 vicryl sutures. the skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 30 vicryl sutures. running 40 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the pacu in a stable condition. all counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure. estimated blood loss 100 ml.,Neurology
476,preoperative diagnosis brain tumors multiple. postoperative diagnoses brain tumors multiple adenocarcinoma and metastasis from breast. procedure occipital craniotomy removal of large tumor using the inner hemispheric approach stealth system operating microscope and cusa. procedure the patient was placed in the prone position after general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. the scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. the cusa was brought in to supplement the use of operating microscope as well as the stealth which was used to localize the tumor. following this we then made a transverse linear incision the scalp galea was reflected and the quadrilateral bone flap was removed after placing burr holes in the midline and over the parietal areas directly over the tumor. the bone flap was elevated. the ultrasound was then used. the ultrasound showed the tumors directly i believe are in the interhemispheric fissure. we noticed that the dura was quite tense despite that the patient had slight hyperventilation. we gave 4 ounce of mannitol the brain became more pulsatile. we then used the stealth to perform a ventriculostomy. once this was done the brain began to pulsate nicely. we then entered the interhemispheric space after we incised the dura in an inverted u fashion based on the superior side of the sinus. after having done this we then used operating microscope and slight selfretaining retraction was used. we obtained access to the tumor. we biopsied this and submitted it.,Neurology
477,this was returned as a malignant brain tumor metastatic tumor adenocarcinoma compatible with breast cancer. following this we then debulked this tumor using cusa and then removed it in total. after gross total removal of this tumor the irrigation was used to wash the tumor bed and a meticulous hemostasis was then obtained using bipolar cautery. the next step was after removal of this tumor closure of the wound a large piece of duragen was placed over the dural defect and the bone flap was reapproximated and held secured with lorenz plates. the tumors self extend into the ventricle and after we had removed the tumor we could see our ventricular catheter in the occipital horn of the ventricle. this being the case we left this ventricular catheter in brought it out through a separate incision and connected to sterile drainage. the next step was to close the wound after reapproximating the bone flap. the galea was closed with 20 vicryl and the skin was closed with interrupted 30 nylon sutures inverted with mattress sutures. the sterile dressings were applied to the scalp. the patient returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. hemodynamically remained stable throughout the operation. once again we performed occipital craniotomy total removal of her large metastatic tumor involving the parietal lobe using a biparietal craniotomy.,Neurology
478,the tumor was removed using the combination of cusa ultrasound stealth guidedventriculostomy and the patient will have a second operation today we will perform a selective craniectomy to remove another large tumor in the posterior fossa.,Neurology

486,preoperative diagnoses multiple metastatic lesions to the brain a subtentorial lesion on the left greater than 3 cm and an infratentorial lesion on the right greater than 3 cm. postoperative diagnoses multiple metastatic lesions to the brain a subtentorial lesion on the left greater than 3 cm and an infratentorial lesion on the right greater than 3 cm. title of the operation biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer. insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under stealth stereotactic guidance. right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor. microtechniques for all the above. stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound. indications the patient is a 48yearold woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago. a year ago she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation. she recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office unable to ambulate in a wheelchair. metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases but no spinal cord compression. she had a consult with radiationoncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed. consequently this operation is performed. procedure in detail the patient underwent a planning mri scan with stealth protocol. she was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp. general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. she was placed on the mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position.,Neurology
487,she was well padded secured and so forth. the neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions. the posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with betadine soak scrub followed by betadine paint. this was done only of course after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the stealth system. sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed. a biparietal incision was performed. a linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation. a biparietal craniotomy was carried out carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the stealth stereotactic system. the dura was opened and reflected back to the midline. an inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor. this was very delicate removing the tumor and the cosurgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor. the tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels. at least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region. bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally however was completely controlled.,Neurology
488,complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound. once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area. a linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve. sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull. a burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome. a craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter. it was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus. stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum. the ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor and this was draining csf relieving pressure in the posterior fossa. upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region the brain was noted to be extremely tight thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy. at the posterior fossa a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly. the tumor as the one above was removed both piecemeal and with intraoperative cavitron ultrasonic aspirator. a gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well.,Neurology
489,i then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the cp angle however this was just over the lower cranial nerves and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter. meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well. the posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers. the dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 40 nurolon. the dura was watertight and it was covered with blue glue. gelfoam was placed over the dural closure. then the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using 0 ethibond. subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 20 and 0 vicryl and the skin was closed with running locking 30 nylon. for the cranial incision the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound. the bone flap was brought on to the field. the dura was closed with running and interrupted 40 nurolon. at the beginning of the case dural tackups had been made and these were still in place. the sinuses both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus were covered with thrombinsoaked gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses. once the dura was closed the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the lorenz microplates. the wound was then closed in layers.,Neurology
490,the galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 20 vicryl. the skin was closed with a running locking 30 nylon. estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 l. the patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 l of hespan and almost 3 l of crystalloid. nevertheless her vitals remained stable throughout the case and we hopefully helped her survival and her longterm neurologic status for this really nice lady.,Neurology

494,a linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. weitlaner retractors were inserted. a single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. i placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. a cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. the bone was set aside. the dura was clearly discolored and very tense. the dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a 15 blade. there was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. the dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. the margins of the membrane were coagulated. the microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. the wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. the dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 40 nurolon.,Neurology
495,tackup sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the lorenz plating system. the wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 20 vicryl. finally the skin was closed with running locking 30 nylon. estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 ml. sponge and needle counts were correct. findings chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane. i might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. also it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood.,Neurology
496,reason for visit the patient is an 84yearold man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. he is accompanied by his wife and daughter. history of present illness i first saw him nearly a year ago on december 20 at that time he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months. this included severe cognitive impairment gait impairment and incontinence. he had actually been evaluated at hospital with csf drainage via a temporary spinal catheter but there was no response that was noted. when i saw him there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and i ordered an mri scan of the cervical spine. i subsequently referred him to dr. x who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on july 16 according to his notes this went well. according to the family there has not been any improvement. with regard to the gait and balance they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago. he is virtually unable to walk at all. he needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk. therefore he is always in the wheelchair. he is completely incontinent. he never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom. on the other hand when asked he will indicate that he needs to go. he wears a depends undergarment all the time. he has no headaches. his thinking and memory are worse.,Neurology
497,for the most part he is apathetic. he does not talk very much. he lives in a skilled nursing facility in the alzheimers section. he does have some daytime activities. he takes a nap once a day. he does not read very much. on the other hand he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election. he needs full assistance at the nursing home. medications from the list by the nursing home are aricept 10 mg in the evening carbidopalevodopa 25100 mg three times a day citalopram celexa 40 mg daily colace 100 mg twice a day finasteride proscar 5 mg once a day flomax tamsulosin 0.4 mg once a day multivitamin with iron once a day omeprazole prilosec 20 mg once a day senna 8.6 mg twice a day tylenol 650 mg as needed and promethazine 25 mg as needed. physical exam on examination today this is a pleasant 81yearold man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair. he is well developed well nourished and kempt. vital signs temperature 96.7 pulse 62 respirations 16 and blood pressure 12371. head the head is normocephalic and atraumatic. mental status assessed for orientation recent and remote memory attention span concentration language and fund of knowledge. the minimental state exam score was 1430. he was not at all oriented. he did know we were at sinai hospital on the second floor. he could spell world forward but was mute when asked to spell backwards.,Neurology
498,he was mute when asked to recall 33 objects for delayed recall. he could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons. for comparison the minimental state exam score last december was 2030 when attention was tested by having him spell world backwards and 2830 when tested with serial 7 subtractions. additionally there are times when he stutters or stammers. i do not see any paraphasic errors. there is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia. he is also stimulus bound. there is a tendency to mimic. cranial nerve exam there is no upgaze that i can elicit today. the horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact. this is a change from a year ago. the muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing head turning cough tongue and palate movement. motor exam normal bulk and strength. the tone is characterized by paratonia. there is no atrophy fasciculations drift or tremor. sensory exam intact to light touch. cerebellar exam intact for fingertonose testing that he can perform only by mimicking but not by following verbal commands. gait severely impaired. when in the wheelchair he leans to one side. he cannot getup on his own. he needs assistance. once up he can bear weight but cannot maintain his balance. this would amount to a tinetti score of zero. review of xrays i personally reviewed the ct scan of the brain from november 1 2008 and compared it to the mri scan from a year ago.,Neurology
499,the ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago. the frontal horn span is now 6 cm whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm. the 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm. there is no obvious atrophy although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy. the scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct. assessment the patient has had worsening of his gait his dementia and his incontinence. the new finding for me today is the limited upgaze. this would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles. problemsdiagnoses question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus 331.5. possible supranuclear palsy. severe gait impairment. urinary urgency and incontinence. dementia. plan i had a long talk with him and his family. even though he has already had a trial of csf drainage via spinal catheter at hospital over a year ago i offered this test to them again. i do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan. his family and i discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus. instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference.,Neurology
500,i have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed. i gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale risks benefits and alternatives. i specifically mentioned the 3 chance of infection which mean a 97 chance of no infection.,Neurology

503,the patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. she balances her own checkbook. she does not do her own taxes but she has never done so in the past. she states that she has no problems with cooking meals getting her own meals and she is still currently driving. she denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. she states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. she is unfortunately living alone and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son she denies any symptoms of frank depression. there is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. she lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. she also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in santa cruz or her grandchildren. she denied any sort of personality change paranoid ideas or hallucinations. she does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it.,Neurology
504,when these headaches are very severe she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. she is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. she takes fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. she denies visual or migraine symptoms. review of systems negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness numbness visual changes dysarthria diplopia or dysphagia. she also denies any sort of movement disorders tremors rigidities or clonus. her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age andor nervousness. she is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group. past medical history significant for mesothelioma which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. the patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. this has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. the mesothelioma is in her abdomen. she does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. she states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. furthermore she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. she does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rearenders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position.,Neurology
505,these have all occurred over the past five years. she also has a diagnosis of dementing illness possibly alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. this diagnosis was given in march 2006. medications fiorinal p.r.n. aspirin unclear if baby or full sized premarin unclear of the dose. allergies none. social history significant for her being without a companion at this point. she was born in munich germany. she immigrated to of america in 1957 after her family had to move to eastern germany which was under russian occupation at that time. she is divorced. she used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at ibm. she stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. she denies any significant tobacco alcohol or illicit drugs. she is bilingual speaking german and english. she has known english from before her teens. she has the equivalent of a high school education in germany. she has one brother and one sister both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. she has one son who lives in santa cruz. he has grandchildren. she is trying to contact with her grandchildren. family history significant for lung liver and prostate cancer. her mother died in her 80s of old age but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. whatever that dementing illness was appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient.,Neurology
506,no one else appears to have alzheimer disease including her brother and sister. physical examination her blood pressure is 15292 pulse 80 and weight 80.7 kg. she is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. she occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation missing the day and the date. she also did not know the name of the hospital she thought it was oconnor and she thought she was in orange county and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. she lost three points for recall. even with prompting she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. her mini mental score was 2230. there were no naming problems or problems with repetition. there were also no signs of dysarthria. her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. her extraocular movements were intact. her visual fields were full to confrontation. her sensations of her face arm and leg were normal. there were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. tongue was midline. her palate was symmetric. her face was symmetric as well. strength was approximately 55. she did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. her reflexes were symmetric and 2 except for her toes which were 1 to trace. her plantar reflexes were mute. her sensation was normal for pain temperature and vibration. there were no signs of ataxia on fingertonose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia.,Neurology
507,gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty. summary ms. a is a pleasant 72yearold righthanded woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia most likely alzheimer type. we tactfully discussed the patients diagnosis with her and she felt reassured. we told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying aricept. she stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the aricept so we wrote her another prescription for aricept. the patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease but our lengthy discussion expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to dmv. it was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. she will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the aricept. she was written for aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks and if she has no side effects which typically are gi side effects then she can go up to 10 mg a day. we also reviewed with ms. a the findings for outpatient mri which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup which included an rpr tsh and b12 were all within normal limits.,Neurology
508,family history and social history reviewed and remained unchanged. medications list remained unchanged including plavix aspirin levothyroxine lisinopril hydrochlorothiazide lasix insulin and simvastatin. allergies she has no known drug allergies. fall risk assessment completed and there was no history of falls. review of systems full review of systems again was pertinent for shortness of breath lack of energy diabetes hypothyroidism weakness numbness and joint pain. rest of them was negative. physical examination vital signs today blood pressure was 17066 heart rate was 66 respiratory rate was 16 she weighed 254 pounds as stated and temperature was 98.0. general she was a pleasant person in no acute distress. heent normocephalic and atraumatic. no dry mouth. no palpable cervical lymph nodes. her conjunctivae and sclerae were clear. neurological examination remained unchanged. mental status normal. cranial nerves mild decrease in the left nasolabial fold. motor there was mild increased tone in the left upper extremity. deltoids showed 55. the rest showed full strength. hip flexion again was 55 on the left. the rest showed full strength. reflexes reflexes were hypoactive and symmetrical. gait she was mildly abnormal. no ataxia noted. widebased ambulated with a cane. impression status post cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle with a mild left hemiparesis has been clinically stable with mild improvement. she is planned for surgical intervention for the internal carotid artery.,Neurology
509,recommendations at this time again we discussed continued use of antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy to reduce her risk of future strokes. she will continue to follow with endocrinology for diabetes and thyroid problems. i have recommended a strict control of her blood sugar optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control regular exercise and healthy diet and i have discussed with ms. a and her daughter to give us a call for post surgical recovery. i will see her back in about four months or sooner if needed.,Neurology
510,reason for referral facial twitching. history of present illness the patient had several episodes where she felt like her face was going to twitch which she could suppress it with grimacing movements of her mouth and face. she reports she is still having right posterior head pressure like sensations approximately one time per week. these still are characterized by a tingling pressure like sensation that often has a feeling as though water is running down on her hair. this has also decreased in frequency occurring approximately one time per week and seems to respond to overthecounter analgesics such as aleve. lastly during conversation today she brought again the problem of daydreaming at work and noted that she occasionally falls asleep when sitting in nonstimulating environments or in front of the television. she states that she feels fatigued all the time and does not get good sleep. she describes it as insomnia but upon questioning she works from 4 till mid night and then gets home and cannot go to sleep for approximately two hours and wakes up reliably by 9.00 a.m. each morning and sleeps no more than five to six hours ever but usually five hours. her sleep is relatively uninterrupted except for the need to get up and go to the bathroom. she thinks she may snore but she is not sure. she does not recall any events of awakening and gasping for breath. past medical history please see my earlier notes in chart.,Neurology
511,family history please see my earlier notes in chart. social history please see my earlier notes in charts. review of systems today she mainly endorses the tingling sensation in the right posterior head often bilateral as well as a diagnosis of depression and persistent somewhat sad mood poor sleep and possible snoring otherwise the 10system review is negative. physical examination general examination unremarkable mainly for mildtomoderate obesity with a weight of 258 pounds. otherwise general examination is unremarkable. neurological examination as before is nonfocal. please see note in chart for details. pertinent findings since the last evaluation she has had an mri performed which was largely unremarkable except for a 1.2 cm lobular t2 hyperintense abnormality at the right clivus and petrous carotid canal which does not enhance. the nature of this lesion is unclear. certainly this abnormality would not explain her left facial twitching and is unlikely to be involved with the right posterior sensory changes she experiences. labs she was supposed to have lyme titers and thyroid tests as well as fasting glucose which were not done however in light of her improvement these may not need to be performed at this time. impression left facial twitchingappears to be improving. most likely this is a peripheral nerve injury related to her abscess as previously described. in light of her negative mri and clinical improvement we discussed options and elected to just observe for now. posterior pressure like headache also appears to be improving.,Neurology
512,the etiology is unclear but as it responds nicely to nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and is decreasing no further evaluation is needed. probable circadian sleep disorder related to her nighttime work schedule and awakening at 9.00 a.m. with insufficient sleep. there is also the possibility of consistent obstructive sleep apnea and if symptoms worsen then we should consider doing a sleep study. for the time being sleep hygiene measures were discussed with the patient including trying to sleep later at least till 10.00 a.m. or 10.30 to get a fullnight sleep. she is on vacation next week and is going to try to see if this will help. we also discussed as before weight loss and exercise which could be helpful. right clivus and petrous lesion of unknown etiology. we will repeat the mri at four months to see for interval change. the patient voiced understanding of these plans and will be following up with me in five months.,Neurology
513,cc intermittent binocular horizontal vertical and torsional diplopia. hx 70yo rhm referred by neuroophthalmology for evaluation of neuromuscular disease. in 791 he began experiencing intermittent binocular horizontal vertical and torsional diplopia which was worse and frequent at the end of the day and was eliminated when closing one either eye. an mri brain scan at that time was unremarkable. he was seen at uihc strabismus clinic in 593 for these symptoms. on exam he was found to have intermittent right hypertropia in primary gaze and consistent diplopia in downward and rightward gaze. this was felt to possibly represent graves disease. thyroid function studies were unremarkable but orbital echography suggested graves orbitopathy. the patient was then seen in the neuroophthalmology clinic on 122392. his exam remained unchanged. he underwent tensilon testing which was unremarkable. on 11393 he was seen again in neuroophthalmology. his exam remained relatively unchanged and repeat tensilon testing was unremarkable. he then underwent a partial superior rectus resection od with only mild improvement of his diplopia. during his 82796 neuroophthalmology clinic visit he was noted to have hypertropia od with left pseudogaze palsy and a right ptosis. the ptosis improved upon administration of tensilon and he was placed on mestinon 30mg tid. his diplopia subsequently improved but did not resolve. the dosage was increased to 60mg tid and his diplopia worsened and the dose decreased back to 30mg tid. at present he denied any fatigue on repetitive movement.,Neurology

518,i spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis prognosis natural history nonoperative and operative treatment options. i laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions. the patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. i explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms although they may not help with the weakness. she feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention. i described the procedure consisting of c45 c56 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model. i explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. she understands. i discussed the risks benefits and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding infection neurovascular injury dural tear singular or multiple muscle weakness paralysis hoarseness of voice difficulty swallowing pseudoarthrosis adjacent segment disease and the risk of this given the patients relatively young age. of note the patient does have a hoarse voice right now given the fact that she feels she has allergies. i also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. she understands. she would like to proceed with the surgery relatively soon. she has her birthday coming up on 072007 and would like to hold off until after then.,Neurology
519,as you know the patient is a 50yearold righthanded caucasian female who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant. her neurological history first begins in december of 1987 when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk. she had hmo insurance at that time and saw a neurologist whose name she does not recall. she thinks that she underwent mri scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests. she was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made. the slurred speech resolved after a few weeks but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved. she also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking. in about 1993 she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia. she saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing. she was diagnosed as having overactive bladder but the cause of this was never determined. she was treated with medications possibly ditropan without much benefit. she also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it. also in about 1993 she began to note an uncomfortable stiffness in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles. apparently the swelling was not visible by others. she saw multiple physicians and was told that it was not arthritis but no definite diagnosis was ever established.,Neurology
520,she saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal. no clearcut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms. however over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat. she states from timetotime she could barely walk. she felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were walking on stilts. she tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit. she began to tire more easily when walking. in 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist. in the fall of 2002 she was seen by dr. x. he ordered an mri scan of her brain and lumbar spine. he also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing. after reviewing everything he diagnosed multiple sclerosis. however prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy he referred her for a second opinion to dr. y in january of 2003. dr. y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. the patient then returned to dr. x and was started on avonex. she continued on it for about six months. however it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it. she also recalled being tried on baclofen by dr. x but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy. so she discontinued it also.,Neurology
521,at that point in time she decided to try a program of good nutrition vitamin supplements and fish oil. in december 2004 and extending up to february 2005 she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities. she began to have to use a cane. she was seen in neurological consultation by dr. z. she was treated with a medrol dosepak. her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically. however within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline. she was then treated with intravenous solumedrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or medrol taper july 2005. this seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids but was partially beneficial. however it wore off once again. a repeat mri scan of the brain in april 2005 was said to look better. she was started on zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit. finally six days ago she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets. she takes onehalf tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs. she continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity. she has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents. the patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability. there is no history of diplopia dysarthria aphasia focal weakness numbness paresthesias cognitive dysfunction or memory dysfunction. past medical history essentially noncontributory.,Neurology
522,allergies the patient is allergic to lobster and vicodin. she feels that she is probably allergic to iodine. social history she does not smoke. she takes one glass of wine per day. past surgical history she has not had any prior surgeries. her general health has been excellent except for the aboveindicated problems. review of outside radiological studies the patient brought with her today mri scans of the brain thoracic spine and lumbosacral spine performed on 111402 on a 1.5tesla magnet. there are numerous t2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum. there appear to be dawsons fingers. the mri of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities. also available are the mri scans of the brain cervical spine thoracic spine and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35tesla magnet on 042205. the mri of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions. however the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35tesla and is suboptimal. visualization of the cord is also suboptimal but there are no clearcut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord. it is difficult to be certain that there are no intraaxial lesions but i could not clearly see one. physical examination vital signs blood pressure 15188 pulse 92 temperature 99.5f and weight 124 lb dressed. general welldeveloped wellnourished female in no acute distress.,Neurology

529,pertinent data mri of the brain from 050206 and mri of the cspine from 050206 and 072506 were personally reviewed. mri of the brain is broadly within normal limits. mri of the cspine reveals large central disc herniation at c6c7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. there is also a fairly large disc at c3c4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. i do not appreciate any cord edema at this level. impression and plan the patient is a 45yearold female with cervical spondylosis with a large c6c7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. she has a small disc at c3c4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. history and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy. results were discussed with the patient and her mother. i am concerned about progressive symptoms. although she only has subtle symptoms now we made her aware that with progression of this process she may have paralysis. if she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident she could have an acute paralysis. i strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. i agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as i am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since november 2005 have contributed to this problem.,Neurology

561,he also has a longstanding history of neck pain. his neurological examination is normal. he has an mri that shows some degenerative changes. i do believe that his symptoms are probably referable to his neck. however i do not think that they are severe enough for him to undergo surgery at this point in time. perhaps another course of physical therapy may be helpful for him. i probably would not recommend anymore invasive procedure such as a spinal stimulator as this pain really is minimal. we could still try to treat him with neuropathic pain medications. recommendations i scheduled him to return for an emg and nerve conduction studies to determine whether there is any evidence of nerve damage although i think the likelihood is low. i gave him a prescription for neurontin. i discussed the side effects of the medication with him. we can discuss his case tomorrow at spine conference to see if there are any further recommendations.,Neurology
562,xyz re abc medical record 123 dear dr. xyz i saw abc back in neurooncology clinic today. he comes in for an urgent visit because of increasing questions about what to do next for his anaplastic astrocytoma. within the last several days he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. the patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. it is clear that his mri is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. despite repeatedly emphasizing this however the patient still is worried about potential longterm side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time. after seeing you in clinic he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. they came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. they then wanted another mri to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation. from my view i noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since i last saw him. this is very worrisome. today for the first time i felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well.,Neurology
563,therefore there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. it suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future. emphasizing this once again in addition to recommending steroids i once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. despite an hour this again amazingly was not possible. it is not that he does not want treatment however. because i told him that i did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised we compromised and elected to go back to temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. we would plan on giving 75 mgsq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. in addition we will stop thalidomide 100 mgday. if he tolerates this for one week we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. at this stage we are thinking of using accutane at that point. while i am very uncomfortable with this type of approach i think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. in the spirit of compromise he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later.,Neurology
564,i will look at this as a positive sign because i think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term. i will keep you apprised of followups. if you have any questions or if i could be of any further assistance feel free to contact me. sincerely,Neurology

614,preoperative diagnosis acute acalculous cholecystitis. postoperative diagnosis acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis. procedure performed open cholecystectomy. anesthesia epidural with local. complications none. disposition the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition. specimen gallbladder. brief history the patient is a 73yearold female who presented to abcd general hospital on 07232003 secondary to a fall at home from which the patient suffered a right shoulder as well as hip fracture. the patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07252003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the orthopedics department. subsequently the patient was doing well postoperatively however the patient does have severe o2 and steroiddependent copd and at an extreme risk for any procedure. the patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08072003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain. during the evaluation the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 080803 the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder. the patient did well postdrainage. the patients laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp. however once the tube was removed the patient reobstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed this was done on 08162003. a hida scan had been performed which showed no cystic duct obstruction.,Gastroenterology
615,a tube cholecystogram was performed which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction. there was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder however the pathway was patent. thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies extensive discussions were made with the family and the patients only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy. initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy however with the patients severe copd and risk for ventilator management the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed. intraoperative findings the patients gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas. there were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder. the patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed. operative procedure after informed written consent risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patients family. the patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia. local anesthesia was given with 1 lidocaine. a paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a 15 blade scalpel. next hemostasis was obtained using electro bovie cautery. dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a 10 blade scalpel. next metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered .,Gastroenterology
616,the gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view. dissection with a was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct which were both easily identified. the cystic artery was clipped two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with metzenbaum scissors. the cystic duct was identified. a silk tie 30 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with 30 silk and then cutting in between with a metzenbaum scissors. the gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro bovie cautery. a plane was created. the hemostasis was obtained using the electro bovie cautery as well as some surgicel. the gallbladder was then removed as specimen sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections. permanent sections are still pending. the remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen. the peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running 0 vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figureofeight 0 vicryl sutures. skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition.,Gastroenterology
617,procedure performed nissen fundoplication. description of procedure after informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection bleeding esophageal perforation and death the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. the patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities. teds and venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. a 52french bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by anesthesia above the cardioesophageal junction. a 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper twothirds and lower onethird between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. the fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. a 12 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. two sutures of 0 vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia and then tied to the special 12 mm hasson trocar fitted with a funnelshaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening. pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmhg. a 30degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars.,Gastroenterology
618,the remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along langers line spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. a total of 4 other 1011 mm trocars were placed. under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line at a right supraumbilical position another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line at a left supraumbilical position 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line. all of the trocars were placed without difficulty. the patient was then placed in reverse trendelenburg position. the triangular ligament was taken down sharply and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula. the gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane. the dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane. the phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice. this incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus. then along the inner side of the crus the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane. the liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus.,Gastroenterology
619,the pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve. this allowed free access to the crura left and right and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus and the posterior vagus nerve. attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus. at its left border the left crus was identified. the dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed. the gastrophrenic ligament was incised beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch. by dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus we elongated the intraabdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia. the next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch. this required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel. this dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen away from the gastroepiploic arcade. the esophagus was lifted by a babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port. careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall. confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus. a onehalf inch penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus. the retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve.,Gastroenterology
620,the 52french bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach and the hiatal orifice was repaired. two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice. the last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve. with anterior retraction on the esophagus using the penrose drain a babcock was passed behind the esophagus from right to left. it was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind forming the wrap. the 52french bougie was used to calibrate the external ring. marcaine 0.5 was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. the skin incision was approximated with skin staples. a dressing was then applied. all surgical counts were reported as correct. having tolerated the procedure well the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.,Gastroenterology
621,presentation a 16yearold male presents to the emergency department ed with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. history a 16yearold african american male presents to the ed with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. the patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating. the following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool. the pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge. the patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain. he also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases stds and states that he was screened for hiv infection eight months ago and was negative. the patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week. he states that he had felt feverish on several occasions but has not taken his temperature. he has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue. he thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss. the patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13. he admits to eight previous partners and states that he usually uses a condom. on further questioning the patient states that of his eight partners three were female and five were male.,Gastroenterology
622,his most recent sexual partner was a 38yearold man whom he has been with for the past six months. he states that he has been tested for stds in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing. he is unaware of the hiv status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy. the patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family. as the man was a member of the familys church the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life. he is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men. he is accessing care in the ed unaccompanied by an adult. physical exam thin but nontoxic young man with clear discomfort. pulse 105 rr 23 bp 12062 heent several areas of white plaquelike material on the buccal mucosa. neck multiple anteriorposterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains 12 cm in diameter. lungs clear to auscultation. cardiac quiet precordium. nl s1s2 with a iivi systolic murmur. abdomen soft without hepatosplenomegaly. gu tanner v male with no external penile lesions. lymph 23 cm axillary nodes bilaterally. 12 cm epitrochlear nodes. multiple 12 cm inguinal nodes. rectal extremely painful digital exam. gross blood and mucous. laboratory evaluation hbg 12.,Gastroenterology

624,although not ideal in many circumstances testing for hiv infection is crucial when there is suspicion since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when hiv counseling and testing were not performed. second this young man has had both male and female sexual partners. as young people explore their sexuality asking about partners in an open nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors. assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have samesex attractions. third screening for stds must take into account sexual behaviors. although urinebased screening has expanded testing of young people it misses anal and pharyngeal infections. if a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse urine screening is insufficient to rule out stds. fourth this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms. as his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current std performing an hiv test should be part of the standard evaluation. in addition as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis pcr testing should also be considered. the care provided to this young man included the following. he was treated presumptively for proctitis with both im ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis. ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant n gonorrhoeae.,Gastroenterology
625,at the time of the diagnosis the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescentspecific hiv program. the case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support. the case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later. over the subsequent three months the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his hiv infection. set 1 cd4 tlymphocyte count 225 cellsmm3 15 quantitative rna pcr 75 000 copiesml,Gastroenterology
626,history of present illness the patient is a 48yearold man who has had abdominal pain since october of last year associated with a 30pound weight loss and then developed jaundice. he had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital. a thinslice ct scan was performed which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases. the patient additionally had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas. the patient underwent ercp on 04042007 with placement of a stent. this revealed a strictured pancreatic duct as well as strictured bile duct. a 10french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage. the next morning the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable. he additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests. of note the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission. this responded to zofran. it did not initially respond well to phenergan though after stent placement he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea and in fact had better response to the phenergan itself. at the time of discharge the patients white count was 9.4 hemoglobin 10.8 hematocrit 32 with a mcv of 79 platelet count of 585 his sodium was 132 potassium 4.1 chloride 95 co2 27 bun of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3. his bilirubin was 17.1 alk phos 273 ast 104 alt 136 total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.,Gastroenterology
627,he was tolerating a regular diet. the patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient but in hospital he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale. the patient will be transferred back to pelican bay under the care of dr. x at the infirmary. he will be further managed for his diabetes there. the patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings. i discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient. certainly there are modest benefits which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer though at some cost with morbidity. the patient will consider this and will discuss this further with dr. x. discharge medications phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n. duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d. benadryl 2550 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus. sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at pelican bay infirmary. the patient had initially been on enalapril here. his hypertension will be managed by dr. x as well. plan the patient should return for repeat ercp if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever increased bilirubin worsening pain. in the meantime he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per dr. x.,Gastroenterology
628,history of present illness the patient is a 55yearold hispanic male who was seen initially in the office february 15 2006 with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain nausea dizziness and bloating. the patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before dr. x in las cruces and his primary care physician in silver city and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody. also the patient had admission in gila medical center with epigastric pain diarrhea and confusion. he spent 3 days in the hospital. he was followed by dr. x and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient. from the patients report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection. at the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain nausea vomiting fever and chills. physical examination vital signs weight 107 height 6 feet 1 inch blood pressure 12867 heart rate 74 saturation 98 pain is 310 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area. heent perrla. eom intact. oropharynx is clear of lesions. neck supple. no lymphadenopathy. no thyromegaly. lungs clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral. cardiovascular regular rate and rhythm. no murmurs rubs or gallops. abdomen not tender not distended. splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin. no hepatomegaly.,Gastroenterology
629,bowel sounds present. musculoskeletal no cyanosis no clubbing no pitting edema. neurologic nonfocal. no asterixis. no costovertebral tenderness. psyche the patient is oriented x4 alert and cooperative. laboratory data we were able to collect lab results from medical center we got only cmp from the hospital which showed glucose level 79 bun 9 creatinine 0.6 sodium 136 potassium 3.5 chloride 104 co2 23.7 calcium 7.3 total protein 5.9 albumin 2.5 total bilirubin 5.63. his ast 56 alt 37 alkaline phosphatase 165 and his ammonia level was 53. we do not have any other results back. no hepatitis panels. no alphafetoprotein level. the patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information. assessment and plan the patient is a 55yearold with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis unknown cause. epigastric pain. the patient had chronic pain syndrome he had multiple back surgeries and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time. in the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam. his pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously. he probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates which should be addressed with his primary care physician. endstage liver disease.,Gastroenterology
630,of course we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis. we do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before. we do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past. again patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in las cruces dr. x. the patient was advised to contact dr. x by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result. it will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time. we are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alphafetoprotein level. we will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in gila medical center but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver. we have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis a and b. until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patients endstage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis c. the patient denied any excessive alcohol intake but i could not preclude alcoholrelated liver cirrhosis also. we will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before. psc is extremely unlikely but possible. wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not.,Gastroenterology
631,alpha1antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem. on his endstage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly. we know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low. i suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy. we do not know if inr was checked to look for coagulopathy. the patient had an egd in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in silver city. we have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that. at this point in time i recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 ml 3 times daily. the patient tolerated it well no diarrhea at this point in time. i also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him. as a primary prophylaxis of gi bleeding in patient with endstage liver disease we will try to use inderal. the patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills. he will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25 from 75 to probably 6058. the patient was educated how to use inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication. the patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic.,Gastroenterology
632,again the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests i mentioned above. we also discussed nutrition issues. the patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day. he was advised not to overeat protein and advised not to starve. he also was advised to stay away from alcohol. his next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available.,Gastroenterology

653,preoperative diagnoses cholelithiasis cholecystitis and recurrent biliary colic. postoperative diagnoses severe cholecystitis cholelithiasis choledocholithiasis and morbid obesity. procedures performed laparoscopy laparotomy cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram choledocholithotomy with operative choledochoscopy and ttube drainage of the common bile duct. anesthesia general. indications this is a 63yearold white male patient with multiple medical problems including hypertension diabetes endstage renal disease coronary artery disease and the patient is on hemodialysis who has had recurrent episodes of epigastric right upper quadrant pain. the patient was found to have cholelithiasis on last admission. he was being worked up for this including cardiac clearance. however in the interim he returned again with another episode of same pain. the patient had a hida scan done yesterday which shows nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with cystic duct obstruction. because of these laparoscopic cholecystectomy was advised with cholangiogram. possibility of open laparotomy and open procedure was also explained to the patient. the procedure indications risks and alternatives were discussed with the patient in detail and informed consent was obtained. description of procedure the patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia. the entire abdomen was prepped and draped. a small transverse incision was made about 212 inches above the umbilicus in the midline under local anesthesia. the patient has a rather long torso. fascia was opened vertically and stay sutures were placed in the fascia. peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. hasson cannula was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and it was insufflated with co2.,Gastroenterology
654,laparoscopic camera was inserted and examination at this time showed difficult visualization with a part of omentum and hepatic flexure of the colon stuck in the subhepatic area. the patient was placed in reverse trendelenburg and rotated to the left. an 11mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5mm in the right subcostal region. slowly the dissection was carried out in the right subhepatic area. initially i was able to dissect some of the omentum and hepatic flexure off the undersurface of the liver. then some inflammatory changes were noted with some fatty necrosis type of changes and it was not quite clear whether this was part of the gallbladder or it was just pericholecystic infectioninflammation. the visualization was extremely difficult because of the patients obesity and a lot of fat intraabdominally although his abdominal wall is not that thick. after evaluating this for a little while we decided that there was no way that this could be done laparoscopically and proceeded with formal laparotomy. the trocars were removed. a right subcostal incision was made and peritoneal cavity was entered. a bookwalter retractor was put in place. the dissection was then carried out on the undersurface of the liver. eventually the gallbladder was identified which was markedly scarred down and shrunk and appeared to have palpable stone in it. dissection was further carried down to what was felt to be the common bile duct which appeared to be somewhat larger than normal about a centimeter in size.,Gastroenterology
655,the duodenum was kocherized. the gallbladder was partly intrahepatic. because of this i decided not to dig it out of the liver bed causing further bleeding and problem. the inferior wall of the gallbladder was opened and two large stones one was about 3 cm long and another one about 1.5 x 2 cm long were taken out of the gallbladder. it was difficult to tell where the cystic duct was. eventually after probing near the neck of the gallbladder i did find the cystic duct which was relatively very short. intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done using carm fluoroscopy. this showed a rounded density at the lower end of the bile duct consistent with the stone. at this time a decision was made to proceed with common duct exploration. the common duct was opened between stay sutures of 40 vicryl and immediately essentially clear bile came out. after some pressing over the head of the pancreas through a kocherized maneuver the stone did fall into the opening in the common bile duct. so it was about a 1cm size stone which was removed. following this a 10french red rubber catheter was passed into the common bile duct both proximally and distally and irrigated generously. no further stones were obtained. the catheter went easily into the duodenum through the ampulla of vater. at this point a choledochoscope was inserted and proximally i did not see any evidence of any common duct stones or proximally into the biliary tree.,Gastroenterology
656,however a stone was found distally still floating around. this was removed with stone forceps. the bile ducts were irrigated again. no further stones were removed. a 16french ttube was then placed into the bile duct and the bile duct was repaired around the ttube using 40 vicryl interrupted sutures obtaining watertight closure. a completion ttube cholangiogram was done at this time which showed slight narrowing and possibly a filling defect proximally below the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct although externally i was unable to see anything or palpate anything in this area. because of this the ttube was removed and i passed the choledochoscope proximally again and i was unable to see any evidence of any lesion or any stone in this area. i felt at this time this was most likely an impression from the outside which was still left over a gallbladder where the stone was stuck and it was impressing on the bile duct. the bile duct lumen was widely open. ttube was again replaced into the bile duct and closed again and a completion ttube cholangiogram appeared to be more satisfactory at this time. the cystic duct opening through which i had done earlier a cystic duct cholangiogram this was closed with a figureofeight suture of 20 vicryl and this was actually done earlier and completion cholangiogram did not show any leak from this area.,Gastroenterology
657,the remaining gallbladder bed which was left in situ was cauterized both for hemostasis and to burn off the mucosal lining. subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. hemostasis was good. a 10mm jacksonpratt drain was left in the foramen of winslow and brought out through the lateral 5mm port site. the ttube was brought out through the middle 5mm port site which was just above the incision. abdominal incision was then closed in layers using 0 vicryl running suture for the peritoneal layer and 1 novafil running suture for the fascia. subcutaneous tissue was closed with 30 vicryl running sutures in two layers. subfascial and subcutaneous tissues were injected with a total of 20 ml of 0.25 marcaine with epinephrine for postoperative pain control. the umbilical incision was closed with 0 vicryl figureofeight sutures for the fascia 20 vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin. sterile dressing was applied and the patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition.,Gastroenterology
658,preoperative diagnosis acute cholecystitis. postoperative diagnosis acute gangrenous cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. operation performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram. findings the patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bilepus coming from the gallbladder. complications none. ebl scant. specimen removed gallbladder with stones. description of procedure the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia. a curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus. through this incision the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization. once this complete insufflation was begun. once insufflation was adequate additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant. once all four ports were placed the right upper quadrant was then explored. the patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis. this was taken down using bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder. the gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall. adhesions were further taken down between the omentum the colon and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area. once the adhesions were fully removed the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction. at this point due to the patients gallbladder being very necrotic it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed.,Gastroenterology
659,the cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected. the gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder. adequate hemostasis with bovie cautery was achieved. the gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port. a jp drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 30 nylon suture. next the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator. once this was complete the additional ports were able to be removed. the fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 vicryl suture in a figureof8 fashion. all skin incisions were injected using marcaine 14 percent plain. the skin was reapproximated further using 40 monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.,Gastroenterology
660,procedure performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with attempted intraoperative cholangiogram. procedure after informed consent was obtained the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. a 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. the fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. a 12 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. two sutures of 0 vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia and then tied to the special 12 mm hasson trocar fitted with a funnelshaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmhg. the remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along langers lines spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. a total of 3 other trocars were placed. the first was a 1011 mm trocar in the upper midline position. the second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine. the third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars.,Gastroenterology
661,all of the trocars were placed without difficulty. the patient was then placed in reverse trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. the gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. a laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula fitted with a reducer and the structures within the triangle of calot were meticulously dissected free. a laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder. the gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a finetipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips. several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made. despite numerous attempts at several angles the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct. after several such attempts and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography. the distal cystic duct was doubly clipped. the duct was divided between the clips. the clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. the port sites were injected with 0.5 marcaine. the cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct. it was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues.,Gastroenterology
662,a laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. the artery was divided between the clips. the port sites were injected with 0.5 marcaine. after the cystic duct and artery were transected the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using bovie electrocautery. prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none. after the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 1011 mm cannula. the neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm hasson cannula. as the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. the neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a kocher clamp and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. following gallbladder removal the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen. both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 vicryl suture. all skin incisions were approximated with 40 vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. the skin was prepped with benzoin and steristrips were applied. dressings were applied. all surgical counts were reported as correct. having tolerated the procedure well the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition.,Gastroenterology

703,preoperative diagnosis large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. postoperative diagnosis large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia. operative time three hours. anesthesia time four hours. description of procedure after thorough preoperative evaluation the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity iv access and radial aline general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. a foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed. the chest abdomen both groin and perineum were prepped widely with betadine and draped as a sterile field with an ioban drape. a long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered. a sterile omnitract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed. with the exception of the vascular findings to be described there were no apparent intraabdominal abnormalities. the transverse colon retracted superiorly. the small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant. the posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein. dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries. the mid left renal artery was likewise identified. the perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery.,Gastroenterology
704,during this portion of the dissection the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis. the distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery. the arteries were suitable for control. the patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time. the aneurysm was repaired. first the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps. the inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery. the aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed. there was a highgrade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site. the vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp. two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 20 silk. a 14 mm hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn endtoend fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 30 prolene suture. at the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 30 prolene were required for hemostasis. the graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn endtoend at the iliac bifurcation using semicontinuous 30 prolene suture.,Gastroenterology
705,prior to completion of this anastomosis the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation. the distal anastomosis was competent without leak. the patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation. the back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous. the colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 20 silk. the aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 30 pds in a vestoverpants fashion. the posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 30 pds. the entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the sma normal appearance of the entire viscera. the ng tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location. the midline fascia was then reapproximated using running 1 pds suture. the subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution. the skin edges coapted using surgical staples. at the conclusion of the case sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied.,Gastroenterology

707,preoperative diagnosis acute appendicitis. postoperative diagnosis acute appendicitis. operative procedure laparoscopic appendectomy. intraoperative findings include inflamed nonperforated appendix. operative note the patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area. the risks of the procedure were explained. she was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery. general anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a foley catheter was inserted. the left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with betadine and draped in sterile fashion. a 5mm blunt port was inserted infraumbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5mm 0degree laparoscope. once we were inside the abdominal cavity co2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum. a left lower quadrant 5mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12mm port in the suprapubic region. the 5mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized. the base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated. i then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix. the window is big enough to get an endo gia blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty. i reloaded with a red vascular cartridge came across the mesoappendix without difficulty. i then placed the appendix in an endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty.,Gastroenterology
708,i reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry. one final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line. we then removed all ports under direct vision and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites. the pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0vicryl suture. the skin incision was injected with 0.25 marcaine and closed with 40 monocryl suture. steristrips and sterile dressings were applied. no complications. minimal blood loss. specimen is the appendix. brought to the recovery room in stable condition.,Gastroenterology
709,reason for consultation pneumatosis coli in the cecum. history of present illness the patient is an 87yearold gentleman who was admitted on 102707 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia. the patient is very difficult to obtain information from however he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. in addition this hospitalization he has undergone an upper endoscopy which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic. he had a ct scan on friday 110207 which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions which could be metastatic disease versus cysts. in discussions with the patient he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain. past medical history obtained from the medical chart. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease history of pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia osteoporosis alcoholism microcytic anemia. medications per his current medical chart. allergies no known drug allergies. social history the patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago. he does have chronic alcohol use. physical examination general a very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment. vital signs afebrile. heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation. respiratory rate is 1720. blood pressure 130s150s60s70s. neck soft and supple full range of motion. heart regular.,Gastroenterology

742,reason for visit followup of laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy. history of present illness the patient is a delightful baby girl who is now nearly 8 months of age and had a tracheostomy for subglottic stenosis. laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy was done because of the need for enteral feeding access and to protect her airway at a time when it is either going to heal enough to improve and allow decannulation or eventually prove that she will need laryngotracheoplasty. dr. x is following the patient for this and currently plans are to perform a repeat endoscopic exam every couple of months to assist the status of her airway caliber. the patient had a laparoscopic fundoplication and gastrostomy on 10052007. she has done well since that time. she has had some episodes of retching intermittently and these seemed to be unpredictable. she also had some diarrhea and poor feeding tolerance about a week ago but that has also resolved. the patient currently takes about 1 ounce to 1.5 ounce of her feedings by mouth and the rest is given by gtube. she seems otherwise happy and is not having an excessive amount of stools. her parents have not noted any significant problems with the gastrostomy site. the patients exam today is excellent. her belly is soft and nontender. all of her laparoscopic trocar sites are healing with a normal amount of induration but there is no evidence of hernia or infection.,Gastroenterology
743,we removed the patients gastrostomy button today and showed her parents how to reinsert one without difficulty. the site of the gastrostomy is excellent. there is not even a hint of granulation tissue or erythema and i am very happy with the overall appearance. impression the patient is doing exceptionally well status post laparoscope fundoplication and gastrostomy. hopefully the exquisite control of acid reflux by fundoplication will help her airway heal and if she does well allow decannulation in the future. if she does require laryngotracheoplasty the protection from acid reflux will be important to healing of that procedure as well. plan the patient will follow up as needed for problems related to gastrostomy. we will see her when she comes in the hospital for endoscopic exams and possibly laryngotracheoplasty in the future.,Gastroenterology

761,the patient was taken to a slightly trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen. the white line of toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation. at this point meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess. when the small bowel was completely freed of abscess bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus. the abscess was cultured and sent it back to bacteriology department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized. at this point the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum. at this point decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first selfretaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed. immediately a gia was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a ta55 balloon roticulator was fired. the specimen was cut with 10 blade bardparker and sent it to pathology. immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with allis. a pursestring device was fired. the staple line was cut. the dilators were used using 25 and 29 then 29 eea was placed and the suture was tied.,Gastroenterology
762,at this point attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators 25 and 29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the 29 ethicon gia was introduced. the spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the culdesac as well as the uterine was present in this patient. immediately the eea was connected with a mushroom. it was tied fired and a doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches. fluid was placed within the and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patients anus insufflating air. no air was seen evolving from the staple line. all fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken. the scope was removed at this point. the case was passed to dr. x for repair of the vesicle fistula. dr. x did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon. after this was performed copious amount of irrigation was used again. more lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area. the incision was performed in the right upper quadrant.,Gastroenterology
763,this incision was performed with cutting in the cautery down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the penrose was passed under transverse colon and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin. the wire was passed under the transverse colon. it was left in place. moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant a jp was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis. at this point immediately yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop pds suture and then tied. electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue. copious amount of irrigation was used. the skin was approximated with staples. at this point immediately the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made. the colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted 30 vicryl suture through the skin edge. one it was completely matured immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened. as previously mentioned the penrose was removed and the bard was secured with a 30 nylon suture. the jp was secured with 30 nylon suture as well. at this point dressings were applied. the patient tolerated the procedure well. the stent from the left ureter was removed and the foley was left in place.,Gastroenterology

805,operation ivorlewis esophagogastrectomy. feeding jejunostomy. placement of two rightsided 28french chest tubes. right thoracotomy. anesthesia general endotracheal anesthesia with a duallumen tube. operative procedure in detail after obtaining informed consent from the patient including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. prior to administration of general anesthesia the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed. in addition he had a duallumen endotracheal tube placed. the patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure. his abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. after applying sterile dressings a 10blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus. dissection was carried down through the linea using bovie electrocautery. the abdomen was opened. next a balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor. next our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach. in an attempt to do so we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade. we incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade. the omentum was divided using suture ligature with 20 silk. we did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 20 silk. next we turned our attention to performing a kocher maneuver.,Gastroenterology
806,this was done and the stomach was freed up. we took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm. we enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest. we also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area. the esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen. we next turned our attention to the left gastric artery. the left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach. we first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties. the left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 20 stick tie reinforcement. at this point the stomach was freely mobile. we then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube. a 20 vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of treitz. we then used bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site. we placed a 16french red rubber catheter through this site. we tied down in place. we then used 30 silk sutures to perform a witzel. next the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 20 silk ties. after doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately we turned our attention to closing the abdomen. this was done with 1 prolene.,Gastroenterology
807,we put in a 2nd layer of 20 vicryl. the skin was closed with 40 monocryl. next we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure. the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. the right chest was prepped and draped appropriately. we then used a 10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral nonmusclesparing fashion. dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with bovie electrocautery. next the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered. the lung was deflated. we placed standard chest retractors. next we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus. we dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein. the azygos vein in fact was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 20 stick ties. as mentioned we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus. after doing this we backed our ng tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring. we used an automatic pursestring and applied. we then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with metzenbaum scissors. we secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus. the pursestring was then tied down without difficulty. next we tabularized our stomach using a 80 gia stapler. after doing so we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using bovie electrocautery.,Gastroenterology
808,we placed our eea stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall. we connected our anvil to the eea stapler. this was then secured appropriately. we checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition. we then fired the stapler. we obtained 2 complete rings 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach which were sent for pathology. we also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology. of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins. we then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening. this was closed with 20 vicryl in a running fashion. we then buttressed this with serosal 30 vicryl interrupted sutures. we returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it. next we placed two 28french chest tubes 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly taking care not to place it near the anastomosis. we then closed the chest with 2 vicryl in an interrupted figureofeight fashion. the lung was brought up. we closed the muscle layers with 0 vicryl followed by 0 vicryl then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 20 vicryl and the skin with 40 monocryl. sterile dressing was applied. the instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the icu in good condition.,Gastroenterology
809,procedure endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy. indication for the procedure patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and ct showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormalappearing ampulla. medications general anesthesia. the risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction bleeding perforation aspiration and post ercp pancreatitis. description of procedure after informed consent and appropriate sedation the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx down the esophagus and into the stomach. the scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. the ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance as it was enlarged and very prominent. it extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. it had what appeared to be adenomatousappearing mucosa on the tip. there also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. the biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. this was located not at the tip of the ampulla but rather more towards the base. cannulation was performed with a wilsoncooke tritome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. the common bile duct was mildly dilated measuring approximately 12 mm. the intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. there were no filling defects identified. there was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. the patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically.,Gastroenterology
810,nevertheless it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. this was done without any complications. there was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy however because of the shape of the ampulla this was unsuccessful. efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position but still were unsuccessful. next biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. four biopsies were taken. there was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. the stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn. findings abnormal papilla with bulging polypoid appearance and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip biopsies taken. cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal cbd stricture although i think this is likely an anatomic variant brush cytology obtained. unable to access the pancreatic duct. recommendations npo except ice chips today. will proceed with mrcp to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy. follow up biopsies and cytology.,Gastroenterology

1011,preoperative diagnoses congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax. rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak. postoperative diagnoses diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia. anesthesia general. indication the patient is an unfortunate 6monthold baby boy who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites. the patient has been treated somewhat successfully with tpn and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition but he had repeated chylothoraces. last week dr. x took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy a thoracic duct leak could be found which would be successfully closed surgically. however at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen. dr. x opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole. this was closed and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease. we met with his parents and talked to them about this and he is here today for that attempt. operative findings the patients abdomen was relatively soft minimally distended. exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity.,Gastroenterology
1012,what we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum the cecum and the portion of the ascending colon. it appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery. there was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved but i did not think that resection of three quarters of the patients small bowel would be viable surgical option. instead we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that. the lymphatic abnormality was extensive. they were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery. they were small aneurysmlike pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well. no other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified. both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well.,Gastroenterology
1013,description of operation the patient was brought from the pediatric intensive care unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow. we conducted a surgical timeout and reiterated all of the patients important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above. preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia. as the peritoneal cavity was entered we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between vicryl ties and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described. the bowel was eviscerated and then with careful inspection we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patients chylous ascites. the small bowel from the ligament of treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected but did not appear that resection of 75 of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for the patient but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems. furthermore it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option.,Gastroenterology
1014,we suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity and then closed the patients abdominal incision with 40 pds on the posterior sheath and 30 pds on the anterior rectus sheath. subcuticular 50 monocryl and steristrips were used for skin closure. the patient tolerated the procedure well. he lost minimal blood but did lose approximately 100 ml of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak. the patient was returned to the pediatric intensive care unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an intestinal transplantation center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time.,Gastroenterology

1073,preoperative diagnosis empyema of the chest left. postoperative diagnosis empyema of the chest left. procedure left thoracotomy with total pulmonary decortication and parietal pleurectomy. procedure detail after obtaining the informed consent the patient was brought to the operating room where he underwent a general endotracheal anesthetic using a doublelumen endotracheal tube. a timeout process had been followed and preoperative antibiotics were given. the patient was positioned with the left side up for a left thoracotomy. the patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. a posterolateral thoracotomy was performed. it included the previous incision. the chest was entered through the fifth intercostal space. actually there was a very strong and hard parietal pleura which initially did not allow us to obtain a good exposure and actually the layer was so tough that the pin of the chest retractor broke. thanks to dr. xs ingenuity we were able to reuse the chest retractor and opened the chest after i incised the thickened parietal pleura resulting in an explosion of gas and pus from a cavity that was obviously welled off by the parietal pleura. we aspirated an abundant amount of pus from this cavity. the sample was taken for culture and sensitivity. then at least half an hour was spent trying to excise the parietal pleura and finally we were able to accomplish that up to the apex and back to the aorta towards the heart including his diaphragm.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1074,once we accomplished that we proceeded to remove the solid exudate that was adhered to the lung. further samples for culture and sensitivity were sent. then we were left with the trapped lung. it was trapped by thickened visceral pleura. this was the most difficult part of the operation and it was very difficult to remove the parietal pleura without injuring the lung extensively. finally we were able to achieve this and after the corresponding lumen of the endotracheal tube was opened we were able to inflate both the left upper and lower lobes of the lung satisfactorily. there was only one area towards the mediastinum that apparently i was not able to fill. this area of course was very rigid but any surgery in the direction would have caused injury so i restrained from doing that. two large chest tubes were placed. the cavity had been abundantly irrigated with warm saline. then the thoracotomy was closed in layers using heavy stitches of vicryl as pericostal sutures and then several figureofeight interrupted sutures to the muscle layers and a combination of nylon stitches and staples to the skin. the chest tubes were affixed to the skin with heavy sutures of silk. dressings were applied and the patient was put back in the supine position and after a few minutes of observation and evaluation he was able to be extubated in the operating room. estimated blood loss was about 500 ml.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1075,the patient tolerated the procedure very well and was sent to the icu in a satisfactory condition.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1076,findings the patients supine blood pressure was 15388 with heart rate of 54 beats per minute. there was no significant change in heart rate or blood pressure on 80degree tilt. no symptoms reported during the tilt study. conclusion tilt table test is negative for any evidence of vasovagal orthostasis or vasodepressor syndrome.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1078,the patient was reintubated by anesthesia with a double lumen endotracheal tube. at this point the patient was repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position with protection of all pressure points and the table was extended in customary fashion. at this point the right chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. the chest tube was removed before prepping the patient and the prior thoracostomy site was cleansed thoroughly with betadine. the first port was placed through this incision intrathoracically. a bronchoscope was placed for inspection of the intrathoracic cavity. pictures were taken. there is extensive fibrinous exudate noted under parietal and visceral pleura encompassing the lung surface diaphragm and the posterolateral aspect of the right thorax. at this point a second port site anteriorly was placed under direct visualization. with the aid of the thoracoscopic view a yankauer resection device was placed in the thorax and blunt decortication was performed and aspiration of reminder of the pleural fluid. due to the gelatinous nature of the fibrinous exudate there were areas of right upper lobe that adhered to the chest wall and the middle and lower lobes appeared entrapped. due to the extensive nature of the disease decision was made to open the chest in a formal right thoracotomy fashion. incision was made. the subcutaneous tissues were then electrocauterized down to the level of the latissimus dorsi which was separated with electrocautery down to the anterior 6th rib space.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1079,the chest cavity was entered with the right lung deflated per anesthesia at our request. once the intrathoracic cavity was accessed a thorough decortication was performed in meticulous systematic fashion starting with the right upper lobe middle and the right lower lobe. with the expansion of the lung and reduction of the pleural surface fibrinous extubate warm irrigation was used and the lungs allowed to reexpand. there was no evidence of gross leakage or bleeding at the conclusion of surgery. full lung reexpansion was noted upon reinflation of the lung. two 32 french thoracostomy tubes were placed one anteriorly straight and one posteriorly on the diaphragmatic sulcus. the chest tubes were secured in place with 0silk sutures and placed on pneumovac suction. next the ribs were reapproximated with five interrupted ctx sutures and latissimus dorsi was then reapproximated with a running 20 vicryl suture. next subcutaneous skin was closed sequentially with a cosmetic layered subcutaneous closure. steristrips were applied along with sterile occlusive dressings. the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the operating room. the chest tubes were maintained on pleurevac suction for full reexpansion of the lung. the patient was transported to the recovery with vital signs stable. stat portable chest xray is pending. the patient will be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring overnight.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1080,preoperative diagnosis esophageal rupture. postoperative diagnosis esophageal rupture. operation performed left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection. esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation. diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy. radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast interpretation. anesthesia general anesthesia. indications of the procedure the patient is a 47yearold male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching. he has esophageal rupture on ct scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy. details of the procedure after an extensive informed consent discussion process the patient was brought to the operating room. he was placed in a supine position on the operating table. after induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. after administration of intravenous antibiotics a left thoracotomy incision was made dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. the left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. the finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. the sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed. immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. the left pleural space was then copiously irrigated.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1081,a careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. there was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. the mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. the tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. it was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. the area was copiously irrigated this provided nice coverage and repair. after final irrigation and inspection two chest tubes were placed including a 36 french right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight 36 french. these were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with 0silk. the intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a 2 vicryl sutures. muscle layers were closed with running 1 vicryl sutures. the wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples. the patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. a laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. a veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion a bladeless 5mm separator trocar was introduced. the laparoscope was introduced. a single additional leftsided separator trocar was introduced.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1082,it was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance. the stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our tfasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely. the skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the seldinger technique. guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire. 18 french gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated. we confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall. the tfasteners were all crimped and secured into position. as was in the plan the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube. sterile dressing was applied. aspiration demonstrated gastric content. gastrostomy tube study with interpretation. radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast with,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1083,preoperative diagnoses empyema of the left chest and consolidation of the left lung. postoperative diagnoses empyema of the left chest consolidation of the left lung lung abscesses of the left upper lobe and left lower lobe. operative procedure left thoracoscopy and left thoracotomy with declaudication and drainage of lung abscesses and multiple biopsies of pleura and lung. anesthesia general. findings the patient has a complex history which goes back about four months ago when she started having respiratory symptoms and one week ago she was admitted to another hospital with hemoptysis and on her evaluation there which included two cat scans of chest she was found to have marked consolidation of the left lung with a questionable lung abscess or cavity with hydropneumothorax. there was also noted to be some mild infiltrates of the right lung. the patient had a 30year history of cigarette smoking. a chest tube was placed at the other hospital which produced some brownish fluid that had foul odor actually what was thought to be a fecallike odor. then an abdominal ct scan was done which did not suggest any communication of the bowel into the pleural cavity or any other significant abnormalities in the abdomen on the abdominal ct. the patient was started on antibiotics and was then taken to the operating room where there was to be a thoracoscopy performed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1084,the patient had a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy that showed no endobronchial lesions but there was bloody mucous in the left main stem bronchus and this was suctioned out. this was suctioned out with the addition of the use of saline in the bronchus. following the bronchoscopy a double lumen tube was placed but it was not possible to secure the double lumen to the place so we did not proceed with the thoracoscopy on that day. the patient was transferred for continued evaluation and treatment. today the double lumen tube was placed and there was some erythema of the mucosa noted in the airways in the bronchi and also remarkably bloody secretions were also noted. these were suctioned but it was enough to produce a temporary obstruction of the left mainstem bronchus. eventually the double lumen tube was secured and an attempt at a left thoracoscopy was performed after the chest tube was removed and digital dissection was carried out through that. the chest tube tract which was about in the sixth or seventh intercostal space but it was not possible to dissect enough down to get a acceptable visualization through this tract. a second incision for thoracoscopy was made about on the sixth intercostal space in the midaxillary line and again some digital dissection was carried out but it was not enough to be able to achieve an opening or space for satisfactory inspection of the pleural cavity.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1085,therefore the chest was opened and remarkable findings included a very dense consolidation of the entire lung such that it was very hard and firm throughout. remarkably the surface of the lower lobe laterally was not completely covered with a fibrotic line but it was more the line anterior and posterior and more of it over the left upper lobe. there were many pockets of purulent material which had a graywhite appearance to it. there was quite a bit of whitish fibrotic fibrinous deposit on the parietal pleura of the lung especially the upper lobe. the adhesions were taken down and they were quite bloody in some areas indicating that the process had been present for some time. there seemed to be an abscess that was about 3 cm in dimension all the lateral basilar segment of the lower lobe near the area where the chest tube was placed. many cultures were taken from several areas. the most remarkable finding was a large cavity which was probably about 11 cm in dimension containing grayish pus and also caseouslike material it was thought to be perhaps necrotic lung tissue perhaps a deposit related to tuberculosis in the cavity. the apex of the lung was quite densely adhered to the parietal pleura there and the adhesions were quite thickened and firm. procedure and technique with the patient lying with the right side down on the operating table the left chest was prepped and draped in sterile manner.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1086,the chest tube had been removed and initially a blunt dissection was carried out through the old chest tube tract but then it was necessary to enlarge it slightly in order to get the thoracoport in place and this was done and as mentioned above we could not achieve the satisfactory visualization through this. therefore the next incision for thoracoport and thoracoscopy insertion through the port was over the sixth intercostal space and a little bit better visualization was achieved but it was clear that we would be unable to complete the procedure by thoracoscopy. therefore posterolateral thoracotomy incision was made entering the pleural space and what is probably the sixth intercostal space. quite a bit of blunt and sharp and electrocautery dissection was performed to take down adhesions to the set of the fibrinous deposit on the pleural cavity. specimens for culture were taken and specimens for permanent histology were taken and a frozen section of one of the most quite dense. suture ligatures of prolene were required.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1087,when the cavity was encountered it was due to some compression and dissection of some of the fibrinous deposit in the upper lobe laterally and anterior and this became identified as a very thin layer in one area over this abscess and when it was opened it was quite large and we unroofed it completely and there was bleeding down in the depths of the cavity which appeared to be from pulmonary veins and these were sutured with a tissue pledget of what was probably intercostal nozzle and endothoracic fascia with prolene sutures. also as the upper lobe was retracted in caudal direction the tissue was quite dense and the superior branch of the pulmonary artery on the left side was torn and for hemostasis a 14french foley catheter was passed into the area of the tear and the balloon was inflated which helped establish hemostasis and suturing was carried out again with utilizing a small pledget what was probably intercostal muscle and endothoracic fascia and this was sutured in place and the foley catheter was removed. the patch was sutured onto the pulmonary artery tear. a similar maneuver was utilized on the pulmonary vein bleeding site down deep in the cavity. also on the pulmonary artery repair some material was used and also thrombin gelfoam and surgicel. after reasonably good hemostasis was established pleural cavity was irrigated with saline. as mentioned biopsies were taken from multiple sites on the pleura and on the edge and on the lung.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1088,then two 24 blake chest tubes were placed one through a stab wound above the incision anteriorly and one below and one in the inferior pleural space and tubes were brought out through stab wounds necked into the skin with 0 silk. one was positioned posteriorly and the other anteriorly and in the cephalad direction of the apex. these were later connected to waterseal suction at 40 cm of water with negative pressure. good hemostasis was observed. sponge count was reported as being correct. intercostal nerve blocks at probably the fifth sixth and seventh intercostal nerves was carried out. then the sixth rib had been broken and with retraction the fractured ends were resected and rongeur used to smooth out the end fragments of this rib. metallic clip was passed through the rib to facilitate passage of an intracostal suture but the bone was partially fractured inferiorly and it was very difficult to get the suture out through the inner cortical table so that pericostal sutures were used with 1 vicryl. the chest wall was closed with running 1 vicryl and then 20 vicryl subcutaneous and staples on the skin. the chest tubes were connected to waterseal drainage with 40 cm of water negative pressure. sterile dressings were applied. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was turned in the supine position where the double lumen endotracheal tube was switched out with single lumen.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1134,sponge and needle counts were correct times 2 at the end of the procedure. the patient was transferred in very stable condition to the pediatric intensive care unit . i was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case. given the magnitude of the operation the unavailability of an appropriate level cardiac surgical resident mrs. x attending pediatric cardiac surgery at the hospital participated during the crossclamp time of the procedure in quality of first assistant.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1135,she was evaluated this a.m. and was without any significant clinical change. her white count has been improving and down to 12 a chest xray obtained today showed some bilateral infiltrates but no acute cardiopulmonary change. there was a suggestion of a bilateral lower lobe pneumonitis or pneumonia. she has been on zosyn for the infection. throughout her hospitalization we have been trying to adjust her pain medications. she states that the methadone did not work for her. she was immune to oxycodone. she had been on tramadol before and was placed back on that. there was some question that this may have been causing some dizziness. she also was on clonazepam and alprazolam for the underlying bipolar disorder. apparently her husband was in this afternoon. he had a box of her pain medications. it is unclear whether she took a bunch of these or precisely what happened. i was contacted that she was less responsive. she periodically has some difficulty to arouse due to pain medications which she has been requesting repeatedly though at times does not appear to have objective signs of ongoing pain. the nurse found her and was unable to arouse her at this point. there was a concern that she had taken some medications from home. she was given narcan and appeared to come around some. breathing remained somewhat labored and she had some diffuse scattered rhonchi which certainly changed from this a.m.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1136,additional narcan was given as well as some medications to reverse a possible benzodiazepine toxicity. with o2 via mask oxygenation was stable at 90 to 95 after initial hypoxia was noted. a chest xray was obtained at this time. an ecg was obtained which shows a sinus tachycardia noted to have ischemic abnormalities. in light of the acute decompensation she was then transferred to the icu. we will continue the iv zosyn. respiratory protocol with respiratory management. continue alprazolam p.r.n. but avoid if she appears sedated. we will attempt to avoid additional pain medications but we will continue with the dilaudid for time being. i suspect she will need something to control her bipolar disorder. pulmonary medicine associates have been contacted to consult in light of the icu admission. at this juncture she does not appear to need an intubation. pending chest xray she may require additional iv furosemide.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1137,preoperative diagnosis varicose veins. postoperative diagnosis varicose veins. procedure performed ligation and stripping of left greater saphenous vein to the level of the knee. stripping of multiple left lower extremity varicose veins. anesthesia general endotracheal. estimated blood loss approximately 150 ml. specimens multiple veins. complications none. brief history this is a 30yearold caucasian male who presented for elective evaluation from dr. xs office for evaluation of intractable pain from the left lower extremity. the patient has had painful varicose veins for number of years. he has failed conservative measures and has felt more aggressive treatment to alleviate his pain secondary to his varicose veins. it was recommended that the patient undergo a saphenous vein ligation and stripping. he was explained the risks benefits and complications of the procedure including intractable pain. he gave informed consent to proceed. operative findings the left greater saphenous vein femoral junction was identified and multiple tributaries were ligated surrounding this region. the vein was stripped from the saphenofemoral junction to the level of the knee. multiple tributaries of the greater saphenous vein and varicose veins from the left lower extremity were ligated and stripped accordingly. additionally there were noted to be multiple regions within these veins that were friable and edematous consistent with acute and chronic inflammatory changes making stripping of these varicose veins extremely difficult. operative procedure the patient was marked preoperatively in the preanesthesia care unit. the patient was brought to the operating suite placed in the supine position.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1138,the patient underwent general endotracheal intubation. after adequate anesthesia was obtained the left lower extremity was prepped and draped circumferentially from the foot all the way to the distal section of the left lower quadrant and just right of midline. a diagonal incision was created in the direction of the inguinal crease on the left. a selfretaining retractor was placed and the incision was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues until the greater saphenous vein was identified. the vein was isolated with a right angle. the vein was followed proximally until a multiple tributary branches were identified. these were ligated with 30 silk suture. the dissection was then carried to the femorosaphenous vein junction. this was identified and 0 silk suture was placed proximally and distally and ligated in between. the proximal suture was tied down. distal suture was retracted and a vein stripping device was placed within the greater saphenous vein. an incision was created at the level of the knee. the distal segment of the greater saphenous vein was identified and the left foot was encircled with 0 silk suture and tied proximally and then ligated. the distal end of the vein stripping device was then passed through at its most proximal location. the device was attached to the vein stripping section and the greater saphenous vein was then stripped free from its canal within the left lower extremity. next attention was made towards the multiple tributaries of the varicose vein within the left lower leg.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1139,multiple incisions were created with a 15 blade scalpel. the incisions were carried down with electrocautery. next utilizing sharp dissection with a hemostat the tissue was spread until the vein was identified. the vein was then followed to t3 and in all these locations intersecting segments of varicose veins were identified and removed. additionally some segments were removed. the stripping approach would be vein stripping device. multiple branches of the saphenous vein were then ligated andor removed. occasionally dissection was unable to be performed as the vein was too friable and would tear from the hemostat. bleeding was controlled with direct pressure. all incisions were then closed with interrupted 30 vicryl sutures andor 40 vicryl sutures. the femoral incision was closed with interrupted multiple 30 vicryl sutures and closed with a running 40 subcuticular suture. the leg was then cleaned dried and then steristrips were placed over the incisions. the leg was then wrapped with a sterile kerlix. once the kerlix was achieved an ace wrap was placed over the left lower extremity for compression. the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to postanesthesia care unit extubated in stable condition. he will undergo evaluation postoperatively and will be seen shortly in the postanesthesia care unit.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1140,history and physical the patient is a 13yearold who has a history of shone complex and has a complete heart block. he is on the pacemaker. he had a coarctation of the aorta and that was repaired when he was an infant. he was followed in our cardiology clinic here and has been doing well. however last night he was sleeping and he states he felt as if he has having a dream and there was thunder in this dream which woke him up. he then felt that his defibrillator was going off and this has continued and feels like his heart rate is not normal. thus his dad put him in the car and transported him here. he has been evaluated here. he had some scar tissue at one point when the internal pacemaker was not working properly and had to have that replaced. it was 2 a.m. when he woke and again he was brought here by private vehicle. he was well prior to going to bed. no cough cold runny nose fever. no trauma has been noted. past medical history shone complex pacemaker dependent. medications he is on no medications at this time. allergies he has no allergies. immunizations up to date. social history he lives with his parents. family history negative. review of system twelve asked all negative except as noted above. physical examination general this is an awake alert male who appears to be in mild distress.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1141,heent pupils are equal round and reactive to light. extraocular movements are intact. his tms are clear. his nares are clear. the mucous membranes are pink and moist. throat is clear. neck supple without lymphadenopathy or masses. trachea is midline. lungs clear. heart shows bradycardia at 53. he has good distal pulses. abdomen soft nontender. positive bowel sounds. no guarding no rebound. no rashes are seen. hospital course initial blood pressure is 16490. he was moved in room 1. he was placed on nasal cannula. pulse ox was 100 which is normal. we placed him on a monitor. we did an ekg it has not appear to be capturing his pacemaker at this time. shortly after the patients arrival the medtronic technician came and worked out his pacemaker. medtronic representative informed me that the lead that he has in place has been recalled because it has been prone to microfractures oversensing and automatic defibrillation. as noted he was transferred to room 1 placed on a monitor pulse ox. an iv was placed. a standard blood work was sent. a chest xray was done showing normal heart size lead appeared to be in placed. there was no evidence of pulmonary edema. his pacemaker did not appear to be capturing. we placed him on transthoracic leads. however it is difficult to get good placement with these because of the area where his pacemaker was placed. the medtronic technician initially turned off his defibrillation mode and turned down his sensor.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1142,however we could not get our transthoracic pacer to capture his heart. when the medtronic representative turned off the pacemaker the heart rate seemed to drop into the 40s. the patient appeared to be in pain. we placed it back on a rate of 60 at that time. he has remained in sinus bradycardia but no evidence of ectopic beats. no widening of his qrs complex. i spoke with cardiology. cardiology service has come in has evaluated him at bedside with me. again we turned up the transthoracic pacer but it is again not seem to be picking up and his heart rate is still going with the medtronics internal pacemaker. so with the icu physician on call dr. x he has agreed with taking this young man to the icu. an hour after presentation here the icu was ready for bed. i accompanied the patient up to the icu. he remained awake and alert. initially he was complaining of a lot of chest pain. once the defibrillator was turned off he had no more pain. he was transported to the pediatrics picu and delivered in stable condition. laboratory data cbc was normal. chem20 was normal as well. impression complete heart block with pacemaker malfunction. plan he is admitted to the icu. time seen critical care time outside billable procedures was 45 minutes with this patient. i should note that a 12lead ekg was done here showing sinus bradycardia normal intervals otherwise.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1143,preoperative diagnosis and indications acute nonstelevation mi. postoperative diagnosis and summary the patient presented with an acute nonstelevation mi. despite medical therapy she continued to have intermittent angina. angiography demonstrated the severe lad as the culprit lesion. this was treated as noted above with angioplasty alone as the stent could not be safely advanced. she has residual lesions of 75 in the proximal right coronary and 60 proximal circumflex and the other residual lad lesions as noted above. she will be continued on her medical therapy. at age 90 she is not a good candidate for aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting. procedure performed selective coronary angiography coronary angioplasty. procedure in detail after informed consent was obtained the patient was taken to the cath lab placed on the table in the supine position. the area of the right femoral artery was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. using the percutaneous technique a 6french sheath was placed in the right femoral artery under fluoroscopic guidance. with the guidewire in place a 5french jl4 catheter was used to selectively angiogram the left coronary system. the catheter was removed. the sheath flushed. the 5french 3drc catheter was then used to selectively angiogram the right coronary artery. the cath removed the sheath flushed. it was decided that intervention was needed in the severe lesions in the lad which appeared to be the culprit lesions for the nonst elevationmi.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1144,the patient was given a bolus of heparin and an act of approximately 50 seconds was obtained we rebolused and the act was slightly lower. we repeated the level and it was slightly higher. we administered 500 more units of heparin and then proceeded with an act of approximately 270 seconds prior to the 500 units of heparin iv. additionally the patient had been given 300 mg of plavix orally during the procedure and integrilin iv bolus and then maintenance drip was started. a 6french cls 3.5 left coronary guide catheter was used to cannulate the left main and hew guidewire was positioned in the distal lad and another hew guidewire in the relatively large third diagonal. an apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was positioned in the distal portion of the mid lad stenosis and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated. angiography was then performed demonstrated marked improvement in the stenosis and this image was used for sizing the last of the needed stent. the balloon was pulled more proximally and then inflated again at 6 atmospheres for approximately 20 seconds with the proximal end of the balloon positioned distal to the origin of the third diagonal so as to not compromise the ostium. the balloon was inflated and removed repeat angiography performed. we attempted to advance a driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent but i could not advance it beyond the proximal lad where there was significant calcification. the stent was removed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1145,attempts to advance the same 2.5 x 15 mm apex balloon that was previously used were unsuccessful. it was removed a new apex 2.5 x 15 mm balloon was then positioned in the proximal lad and inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and advanced slightly with the distal tip of the balloon proximal to the third diagonal ostium and it was inflated to 6 atmospheres for 15 seconds and then deflated and removed. repeat angiography demonstrated no evidence of dissection. one more attempt was made to advance the driver 2.5 x 24 mm bare metal stent but again i could not advance it beyond the calcified plaque in the proximal lad and this was despite the presence of the buddy wire in the diagonal. i felt that further attempts in this calcified vessel in a 90yearold with severe aortic stenosis and severe aortic insufficiency would likely result in complications of dissection so the stent was removed. the guidewires and guide cath were removed. the sheath flushed and sutured into position. the patient moved to icu in stable condition with no chest discomfort at all. contrast isovue370 120 ml. fluoro time 4 minutes. estimated blood loss 30 ml. hemodynamics aorta 18554. left ventriculography was not performed. i did not make an attempt to cross this severely stenotic aortic valve. the left main is a large vessel giving rise to lad and circumflex vessels. the left main has no significant disease other than calcification in the walls.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1146,the lad is a moderatetolarge vessel giving rise to small diagonals and then a moderatetolarge third diagonal and then a small fourth diagonal. the lad has significant calcification proximally. there is a 50 stenosis between the first and second diagonals that we treated with angioplasty alone in an attempt to be able to advance the stent. this resulted in a 30 residual mostly eccentric calcified plaque. following this there was a 50 stenosis in the lad just after the takeoff of the third diagonal. this was not ballooned. beyond this is an 80 stenosis prior to the fourth diagonal and then a 99 stenosis after the fourth diagonal. these 2 lesions were dilated with 10 residual prior to the fourth diagonal and 25 residual distal to the fourth diagonal. as noted above this area was not stented because i could not safely advance the stent. note there was also a 50 stenosis at the origin of the moderatetolarge third diagonal that did not change with angioplasty. the circumflex is a large nondominant vessel consisting of a large obtuse marginal with multiple branches. the proximal circumflex has an eccentric 60 stenosis prior to the takeoff of the obtuse marginal. the remainder of the vessel was without significant disease. the right coronary was a large dominant vessel giving rise to a large posterior descending artery and smalltomoderate first posterolateral small second posterolateral and a smalltomoderate third posterolateral branch.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1147,the right coronary has an eccentric smooth 75 stenosis beginning about a centimeter after the origin of the vessel and prior to the acute marginal branch. the remainder of the right coronary and its branches were without significant disease.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1155,history the patient is a 19yearold boy with a membranous pulmonary atresia underwent initial repair 12041987 consisting of pulmonary valvotomy and placement of 4 mm goretex shunt between the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery with a snare. this was complicated by shunt thrombosis utilizing a 10mm balloon. resulting in significant hypoxic brain injury where he has been left with static encephalopathy and cerebral palsy. on 04071988 he underwent heart catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty utilizing a 10mm balloon. he has been followed conservatively since that time. a recent echocardiogram demonstrated possibly a significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction with tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity predicting a right ventricular systolic pressure in excess of 180 mmhg. right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula was also appreciated. the patient underwent cardiac catheterization to assess hemodynamics associated with his current state of repair. procedure the patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia breathing on 30 oxygen throughout the case. cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets. vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized. monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures. using a 7french sheath a 6french wedge catheter was inserted. the right femoral vein advanced through the right heart structures out to the branch pulmonary arteries. this catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 5french marker pigtail catheter which was directed into the main pulmonary artery.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1156,using a 5french sheath a 5french pigtail catheter was inserted in the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta ascending aorta and left ventricle. this catheter was then exchanged for a judkins right coronary catheter for selective cannulation of the right coronary artery. flows were calculated by the fick technique using a measured assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the main pulmonary artery and right coronary artery. after angiography two normalappearing renal collecting systems were visualized. the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis. the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. there were no complications. discussion oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal. mixed venous saturation was normal with no evidence of intracardiac shunt. leftsided heart was fully saturated. phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an awave similar to the normal right ventricular enddiastolic pressure. right ventricular systolic pressure was mildly elevated at 45 systemic level. there was a 25 mmhg peak systolic gradient across the outflow tract to the main branch pulmonary arteries. phasic branch pulmonary artery pressures were normal. righttoleft pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressures were normal with an awave similar to the normal left ventricular enddiastolic pressure of 12 mmhg. left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta. phasic ascending and descending pressures were similar and normal.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1157,the calculated systemic and pulmonary flows were equal and normal. vascular resistances were normal. angiogram with contrast injection in the main pulmonary artery showed catheter induced pulmonary insufficiency. the right ventricle appeared mildly hypoplastic with a good contractility and mild tricuspid valve regurgitation. there is dynamic narrowing of the infundibulum with hypoplastic pulmonary annulus. the pulmonary valve appeared to be thin and moved well. the median branch pulmonary arteries were of good size with normal distal arborization. angiogram with contrast injection in the right coronary artery showed a nondominant coronary with a small fistula arising from the proximal right coronary artery coursing over the infundibulum and entering the left facing sinus of the main pulmonary artery. initial diagnoses membranous pulmonary atresia. atrial septal defect. right coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula. surgeries interventions pulmonary valvotomy surgical. aortopulmonary artery central shunt. balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. current diagnoses pulmonary valve stenosis supplemented to hypoplastic pulmonary annulus. mild right ventricle outflow tract obstruction due to supple pulmonic narrowing. small right coronary artery to main pulmonary fistula. static encephalopathy. cerebral palsy. management the case to be discussed with combined cardiologycardiothoracic surgery case conference. given the mild degree of outflow tract obstruction in this sedentary patient aggressive intervention is not indicated. conservative outpatient management is to be recommended. further patient care will be directed by dr. x.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1296,the mediastinum was then irrigated with copious amounts of antibiotic saline solution. two chest tubes were then placed including an angled chest tube into the pericardial well on the inferior border of the heart as well as straight mediastinal chest tube. the sternum was then reapproximated with stainless steel wires in the usual manner and the subcutaneous tissue was closed in multiple layers with running vicryl sutures. the skin was then closed with a running subcuticular stitch. the patient was then taken to the intensive care unit in a critical but stable condition.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1297,clinical history a 48yearold smoker found to have a right upper lobe mass on chest xray and is being evaluated for chest pain. pet scan demonstrated a mass in the right upper lobe and also a mass in the right lower lobe which were also identified by ct scan. the lower lobe mass was approximately 1 cm in diameter and the upper lobe mass was 4 cm to 5 cm in diameter. the patient was referred for surgical treatment. specimen a. lung wedge biopsy right lower lobe b. lung resection right upper lobe c. lymph node biopsy level 2 and 4 d. lymph node biopsy level 7 subcarinal final diagnosis a. wedge biopsy of right lower lobe showing adenocarcinoma grade 2 measuring 1 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free resection margin. b. right upper lobe lung resection showing adenocarcinoma grade 2 measuring 4 cm in diameter with invasion of the overlying pleura and with free bronchial margin. two 2 hilar lymph nodes with no metastatic tumor. c. lymph node biopsy at level 2 and 4 showing seven 7 lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor. d. lymph node biopsy level 7 subcarinal showing 5 lymph nodes with anthracosis and no metastatic tumor. comment the morphology of the tumor seen in both lobes is similar and we feel that the smaller tumor involving the right lower lobe is most likely secondary to transbronchial spread from the main tumor involving the right upper lobe.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1298,this suggestion is supported by the fact that no obvious vascular or lymphatic invasion is demonstrated and adjacent to the smaller tumor there is isolated nests of tumor cells within the air spaces. furthermore immunoperoxidase stain for ck7 ck20 and ttf are performed on both the right lower and right upper lobe nodule. the immunohistochemical results confirm the lung origin of both tumors and we feel that the tumor involving the right lower lobe is due to transbronchial spread from the larger tumor nodule involving the right upper lobe.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1309,the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room on april 4 2007 was given general anesthesia and was endotracheally intubated without incident. although he had markedly difficult airway the patient had fiberoptic bronchoscopy performed all the way down to the level of the subsegmental bronchi. no abnormalities were noted in the entire tracheobronchial tree and based on this the decision was made to proceed with the surgery. the patient was kept in the supine position and the singlelumen endotracheal tube was removed and a doublelumen tube was placed. following this the patient was placed into the left lateral decubitus position with the right side up and all pressure points were padded. sterile duraprep preparation on the right chest was placed. a sterile drape around that was also placed. the table was flexed to open up the intercostal spaces. a second bronchoscopy was performed to confirm placement of the doublelumen endotracheal tube. marcaine was infused into all incision areas prior to making an incision. the incisions for the vats right middle lobectomy included a small 1cm incision for the auscultatory incision approximately 4 cm inferior to the inferior tip of the scapula. the camera port was in the posterior axillary line in the eighth intercostal space through which a 5mm 30degree scope was used.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1310,third incision was an anterior port which was approximately 2 cm inferior to the inframammary crease and the midclavicular line in the anterior sixth intercostal space and the third incision was a utility port which was a 4 cm long incision which was approximately one rib space below the superior pulmonary vein. all of these incisions were eventually created during the procedure. the initial incision was the camera port through which under direct visualization an additional small 5mm port was created just inferior to the anterior port. these two ports were used to identify the chest wall lesions which were initially thought to be metastatic lesions. multiple biopsies of the chest wall lesions were taken and the decision was made to also insert the auscultatory incision port. through these three incisions the initial working of the diagnostic portion of the chest wall lesion was performed. multiple biopsies were taken of the entire chest wall offers and specimens came back as negative. the right middle lobe was noted to be adherent to the anterior chest wall. this area was taken down and the entire pleural surface along this area was taken down and sent for frozen pathologic analysis. this also returned as negative with only fibrotic tissue and a few lymphocytes within the fibrotic tissue but no tumor cells. based on this the decision was made to not proceed with chest wall resection and continue with right middle lobectomy.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1311,following this the anterior port was increased in size and the utility port was made and meticulous dissection from an anterior to posterior direction was performed. the middle lobe branch of the right superior pulmonary vein was initially dissected and stapled with vascular load 45mm endogia stapler. following division of the right superior pulmonary vein the right middle lobe bronchus was easily identified. initially this was thought to be the main right middle lobe bronchus but in fact it was the medial branch of the right middle lobe bronchus. this was encircled and divided with a blue load stapler with a 45mm endogia. following division of this the pulmonary artery was easily identified. two branches of the pulmonary artery were noted to be going into the right middle lobe. these were individually divided with a vascular load after encircling with a right angle clamp. the vascular staple load completely divided these arterial branches successfully from the main pulmonary artery trunk and following this an additional branch of the bronchus was noted to be going to the right middle lobe. a fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed intraoperatively and confirmed that this was in fact the lateral branch of the right middle lobe bronchus. this was divided with a blue load stapler 45 mm endogia.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1312,following division of this the minor and major fissures were completed along the edges of the right middle lobe separating the right upper lobe from the right middle lobe as well as the right middle lobe from the right lower lobe. following complete division of the fissure the lobe was put into an endogia bag and taken out through the utility port. following removal of the right middle lobe a meticulous lymph node dissection sampling was performed excising the lymph node package in the 4r area as well as the 7 lymph node package. node station 8 or 9 nodes were easily identified therefore none were taken. the patient was allowed to ventilate under water on the right lung with no obvious air leaking noted. a 19french blake was placed into the posterior apical position and a 32french chest tube was placed in the anteroapical position. following this the patients lung was allowed to reexpand fully and the patient was checked for air leaking once again. following this all the ports were closed with 20 vicryl suture used for the deeper tissue and 30 vicryl suture was used to reapproximate the subcutaneous tissue and 40 monocryl suture was used to close the skin in a running subcuticular fashion. the patient tolerated the procedure well was extubated in the operating room and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1321,chart note she is here to discuss possible open lung biopsy that she has actually scheduled for tomorrow. dr. xyz had seen her because of her complaints of shortness of breath. then she had the pulmonary function test and ct scan and he felt that she probably had usual interstitial pneumonitis but wanted her to have an open lung biopsy so he had her see dr. xyz estep. he had concurred with dr. xyz that an open lung biopsy was appropriate and she was actually scheduled for this but both dr. xyz and i were unavailable before the procedure was originally scheduled so he had it delayed so that she could talk with us prior to having the biopsy. she was ready to go ahead with this and felt that it was important she find out why she is short of breath. she is very concerned about the findings on her cat scan and pulmonary function test. she seemed alarmed to report that dr. xyz had found that her lung capacity was reduced to 60 of what should be normal. however i told her that two years ago dr. xyz did pulmonary function studies which showed the same change in function. and that really her pulmonary function test at least compared from two years ago had not really changed over this period of time.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1322,after discussing the serious nature of an open lung biopsy the fact that her pulmonary function studies have not changed in two years the fact that she likely has a number of other things that are contributing to her being out of breath which is deconditioning and obesity she seemed comfortable with the thought of simply monitoring this a little bit longer before undergoing something as risky as an open lung biopsy. in fact when i called dr. xyz to talk to him about cancelling the procedure he stated he would be very uncomfortable with doing an open lung biopsy on someone with pulmonary function studies which had not changed. i also explained to patient that i did not think dr. xyz was aware that she had had pulmonary function studies two years previously and certainly did not know that there results of those. and also i spoke with dr. xyz who agreed that although the two different tests may have some minor differences accounting for some of the similarity in results that may or may not be completely accurate that generally a person with progressive interstitial lung disease without a fairly substantial change on pulmonary function tests even if they were done at different facilities. i had a 30minute discussion with patient about all of this and showed her the different test results and had a lengthy talk with her about the open lung biopsy and she ultimately felt very uncomfortable with going ahead and decided to cancel it.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1323,i also told her we could continue to monitor her breathing problems and continue to monitor her cat scan xray and pulmonary function tests. and if there was some sign that this was a progressive problem she could still go ahead with the lung biopsy. but she needed to understand that the treatment and likely diagnosis found from an open lung biopsy were not highly likely to be of any great help to her. she understands that the diagnoses made from open lung biopsy are not all that specific and that the treatment for the few specific things that can be detected are not often well tolerated or extremely helpful. we are going to see her back in a month to see how her breathing is doing. we will cancel her open lung biopsy for tomorrow and decide whether she should follow up with a pulmonologist at that time. i told her i would try to talk to her sister sometime in the next day or two.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1358,reason for the visit very high ptinr. history the patient is an 81yearold lady whom i met last month when she came in with pneumonia and chf. she was noticed to be in atrial fibrillation which is a chronic problem for her. she did not want to have coumadin started because she said that she has had it before and the inr has had been very difficult to regulate to the point that it was dangerous but i convinced her to restart the coumadin again. i gave her the coumadin as an outpatient and then the inr was found to be 12. so i told her to come to the emergency room to get vitamin k to reverse the anticoagulation. past medical history congestive heart failure. renal insufficiency. coronary artery disease. atrial fibrillation. copd. recent pneumonia. bladder cancer. history of ruptured colon. myocardial infarction. hernia repair. colon resection. carpal tunnel repair. knee surgery. medications coumadin. simvastatin. nitrofurantoin. celebrex. digoxin. levothyroxine. vicodin. triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide. carvedilol. social history she does not smoke and she does not drink. physical examination general lady in no distress. vital signs blood pressure 10046 pulse of 75 respirations 12 and temperature 98.2. heent head is normal. neck supple. lungs clear to auscultation and percussion. heart no s3 no s4 and no murmurs. abdomen soft. extremities lower extremities no edema. assessment atrial fibrillation. coagulopathy induced by coumadin. plan her inr at the office was 12.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1359,i will repeat it and if it is still elevated i will give vitamin k 10 mg in 100 ml of d5w and then send her home and repeat the ptinr next week. i believe at this time that it is too risky to use coumadin in her case because of her age and comorbidities the multiple medications that she takes and it is very difficult to keep an adequate level of anticoagulation that is safe for her. she is prone to a fall and this would be a big problem. we will use one aspirin a day instead of the anticoagulation. she is aware of the risk of stroke but she is very scared of the anticoagulation with coumadin and does not want to use the coumadin at this time and i understand. we will see her as an outpatient.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1384,procedure left heart catheterization left and right coronary angiography left ventricular angiography and intercoronary stenting of the right coronary artery. procedure in detail the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory. after informed consent he was medicated with versed and fentanyl. the right groin was prepped and draped and infiltrated with 2 xylocaine. percutaneously 6french arterial sheath was placed. selective native left and right coronary angiography was performed followed by left ventricular angiography. the patient had a totally occluded right coronary. we initially started with a jr4 guide. we were able to a sport wire through the total occlusion and saw a very tight stenosis. we were able to get a 30 x 13 mm power saver balloon into the stenosis and dilated. we then attempted to put a 30 x 12 mm stent across the stenosis but we had very little guide support the guide kept coming out. we then switched to an al1 guide and that too did not enable us to get anything to cross this lesion. we finally had to go an al2 guide we were concerned that this could cause some proximal dissection. that guided seated we did have initial difficulty getting the wire back across the stenosis and we did see a little staining suggesting we did have some tearing from the guide tip. the surgeons were put on notice in case we could not get this vessel open but we were able to recross with a sport wire.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1385,we then redilated the area of stenosis and with good guide support we were able to get a 30 x 23 mm vision stent where the lesion was and postdilated it to 18 atmospheres. routine angiography did show that the distal posterolateral branch seems to be occluded whether this was from distal wire dissection or distal thrombosis was unclear but we were able to rewire that area and get a 25 x12 vision balloon and dilate the area and reestablish flow to the small segment. we then came back because of the residual dissection proximal to the first stent and put a 30 x15 mm vision stent at 18 atmospheres. final angiography showed resolution of the dissection. we could see a little staining extrinsic to the stent. no perforation and excellent flow. during the intervention we did give a bolus and drip of angiomax. at the end of the procedure we stopped the angiomax and gave 600 mg of plavix. we did a right femoral angiogram however the angioseal plug could not take so we used manual pressure and a femostop. we transported the patient to his room in stable condition. angiographic data left main coronary is normal. left anterior descending artery has a fair amount of wall disease proximally about 50 to 60 stenosis of the lad before it bifurcates into diagonal. the diagonal does appear to have about 50 osteal stenosis. there is a lot of plaquing further down the diagonal but good flow.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1386,the rest of the lad looked good pass the proximal 60 stenosis and after the diagonal branch. circumflex artery was nondominant vessel consisting of an obtuse marginal vessel. the first obtuse marginal had a long 50 narrowing and then the av groove branch was free of any disease. some mild collaterals to the right were seen. right coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the right coronary just about 0.5 cm after its origin. after we got a wire across the area of occlusion we could see some thrombosis and a 99 stenosis just at the curve. following the balloon angioplasty we established good flow down the distal vessel. we still had about residual 70 stenosis. when we had to go back with the al2 guide we could see a little bit of staining in the proximal portion of the vessel that we did not notice previously and we felt that the tip of the guide caused a little bit of intimal dissection. we redilated and then deployed. repeat angiography now did show some hang up off dye distally. we never did have the wire that far down so this was probably felt to be due to distal embolization of some thrombus. after deploying the stent we had total resolution of the original lesion. we then directed our attention to the posterolateral branch which the remainder of the vessel was patent giving off a large pda. the posterolateral branch appeared to be occluded in its mid portion.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1387,we got a wire through and dilated this. we then came back and put a second stent in the proximal area of the right coronary proximal and abutting to the previous stent. repeat angiography now showed no significant dissection a little bit of contrast getting extrinsic to the stent probably in a little subintimal pouch but this was excluded by the stent. there were no filling defects in the stent and excellent flow. the distal posterolateral branch did open up although it was little underfilled and there may have been some mild residual disease there. impression atherosclerotic heart disease with total occlusion of right coronary successfully stented to zero residual with repair of a small proximal dissection. minor distal disease of the posterolateral branch and 60 proximal left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis and 50 diagonal stenosis along with 50 stenosis of the first obtuse marginal branch.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1505,reason for visit i have been asked to see this 63yearold man with a dilated cardiomyopathy by dr. x at abcd hospital. he presents with a chief complaint of heart failure. history of present illness in retrospect he has had symptoms for the past year of heart failure. he feels in general ok but is stressed and fatigued. he works hard running 3 companies. he has noted shortness of breath with exertion and occasional shortness of breath at rest. there has been some pnd but he sleeps on 1 pillow. he has no edema now but has had some mild leg swelling in the past. there has never been any angina and he denies any palpitations syncope or near syncope. when he takes his pulse he notes some irregularity. he follows no special diet. he gets no regular exercise although he has recently started walking for half an hour a day. over the course of the past year these symptoms have been slowly getting worse. he gained about 20 pounds over the past year. there is no prior history of either heart failure or other heart problems. his past medical history is remarkable for a right inguinal hernia repair done in 1982. he had trauma to his right thumb. there is no history of high blood pressure diabetes mellitus or heart murmur. on social history he lives in san salvador with his wife. he has a lot of stress in his life. he does not smoke but does drink.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1506,he has high school education. on family history mother is alive at age 89. father died at 72 of heart attack. he has 2 brothers and 1 sister all of whom are healthy although the oldest suffered a myocardial infarction. he has 3 healthy girls and 9 healthy grandchildren. a complete review of systems was performed and is negative aside from what is mentioned in the history of present illness. medications aspirin 81 mg daily and chlordiazepoxide and clidinium combination pill at 5 mg2.5 mg 1 tablet daily for stress. allergies denied. major findings on my comprehensive cardiovascular examination he is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 231 pounds. his blood pressure is 12070 in each arm seated. his pulse is 80 beats per minute and regular. he is breathing 1two times per minute and that is unlabored. eyelids are normal. pupils are round and reactive to light. conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric. there is no oral thrush or central cyanosis. neck is supple and symmetrical without adenopathy or thyromegaly. jugular venous pressure is normal. carotids are brisk without bruits. lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. the precordium is quiet. the rhythm is regular. the first and second heart sounds are normal. he does have a fourth heart sound and a soft systolic murmur. the precordial impulse is enlarged. abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses. he has no clubbing cyanosis or peripheral edema. distal pulses are normal throughout both arms and both legs.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1507,on neurologic examination his mentation is normal. his mood and affect are normal. he is oriented to person place and time. data his ekg shows sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy. a metabolic stress test shows that he was able to exercise for 5 minutes and 20 seconds to 90 of his maximum predicted heart rate. his peak oxygen consumption was 19.7 mlkgmin which is consistent with mild cardiopulmonary disease. laboratory data shows his tsh to be 1.33. his glucose is 97 and creatinine 0.9. potassium is 4.3. he is not anemic. urinalysis was normal. i reviewed his echocardiogram personally. this shows a dilated cardiomyopathy with ef of 15. the left ventricular diastolic dimension is 6.8 cm. there are no significant valvular abnormalities. he had a stress thallium. his heart rate response to stress was appropriate. the thallium images showed no scintigraphic evidence of stressinduced myocardial ischemia at 91 of his maximum age predicted heart rate. there is a fixed small sized mildtomoderate intensity perfusion defect in the distal inferior wall and apex which may be an old infarct but certainly does not account for the degree of cardiomyopathy. we got his poststress ef to be 33 and the left ventricular cavity appeared to be enlarged. the total calcium score will put him in the 56 percentile for subjects of the same age gender and raceethnicity. assessments this appears to be a newly diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy the etiology of which is uncertain. problems diagnoses dilated cardiomyopathy. dyslipidemia.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1508,procedures and immunizations none today. plans i started him on an ace inhibitor lisinopril 2.5 mg daily and a betablocker carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily. the dose of these drugs should be uptitrated every 2 weeks to a target dose of lisinopril of 20 mg daily and carvedilol 25 mg twice daily. in addition he could benefit from a loop diuretic such as furosemide. i did not start this as he is planning to go back home to san salvador tomorrow. i will leave that up to his local physicians to uptitrate the medications and get him started on some furosemide. in terms of the dilated cardiomyopathy there is not much further that needs to be done except for family screening. all of his siblings and his children should have an ekg and an echocardiogram to make sure they have not developed the same thing. there is a strong genetic component of this. i will see him again in 3 to 6 months whenever he can make it back here. he does not need a defibrillator right now and my plan would be to get him on the right doses of the right medications and then recheck an echocardiogram 3 months later. if his lv function has not improved he does have new york heart association class ii symptoms and so he would benefit from a prophylactic icd. thank you for asking me to participate in his care. medication changes see the above.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1559,history the patient is a 1012yearold born with asplenia syndrome with a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava complete atrioventricular septal defect a total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the rightsided atrium and doubleoutlet to the right ventricle with malposed great vessels the aorta being anterior with a severe pulmonary stenosis. he had undergone staged repair beginning on 04211997 with a right modified blalocktaussig shunt followed on 09021999 with a bilateral bidirectional glenn shunt and left pulmonary artery to main pulmonary artery pericardial patch augmentation. these procedures were performed at medical college hospital. family states that they moved to the united states. evaluation at the childrens hospital earlier this year demonstrated complete occlusion of the right bidirectional glenn shunt as well as occlusion of the proximal right pulmonary artery. he was also found to have elevated glenn pressures at 22 mmhg transpulmonary gradient axis of 14 mmhg. the qpqs ratio of 0.61. a large decompressing venous collateral was also appreciated. the patient was brought back to cardiac catheterization in an attempt to reconstitute the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and to occlude the venous collateral vessel. description of procedure after sedation and local xylocaine anesthesia the patient was prepped and draped. cardiac catheterization was performed as outlined in the attached continuation sheets. vascular entry was by percutaneous technique and the patient was heparinized. monitoring during the procedure included continuous surface ecg continuous pulse oximetry and cycled cuff blood pressures in addition to intravascular pressures.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1560,using a 6french sheath a 6french wedge catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and advanced from the inferior vena cava into the rightsided atrium pulmonary veins and the right ventricle. using a 6french sheath a 5french pigtail catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery and advanced retrograde to the descending aorta and ascending aorta. a separate port of arterial access was obtained in the left femoral artery utilizing a 5french sheath. percutaneous access into the right jugular vein was attempted but unsuccessful. ultrasound on the right neck demonstrated a complete thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein. using percutaneous technique and a 5french sheath 5french wedge catheter was inserted into the left internal jugular vein and advanced along the left superior vena cava across the left cavalpulmonary anastomosis into the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery with aid of guidewire. this catheter then also advanced into the bridging innominate vein. the catheter was then exchanged over wire for a 4french bernstein catheter which was advanced to the blind end of the right superior vena cava. a balloon wedge angiogram of the right lower pulmonary vein demonstrated back filling of a small right lower pulmonary artery. there was no vascular continuity to the stump of the right glenn. the jugular venous catheter and sheaths were exchanged over a wire for a 6french flexor sheath which was advanced to the proximal right superior vena cava. the bernstein catheter was then reintroduced using a terumo guidewire.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1561,probing of the superior vena cava facilitated access into the right lower pulmonary artery. the angiogram in the right pulmonary artery showed a diminutive right lower pulmonary artery and severe long segment proximal stenosis. the distal pulmonary measured approximately 5.5 to 60 mm in diameter with a long segment stenosis measuring approximately 31 mm in length. the length of the obstruction was balloon dilated using ultrathin sd 4 x 2 cm balloon catheter with complete disappearance of the waist. this facilitated advancement of a flexor sheath into the proximal portion of the stenosis. a pg 2960 bpx genesis stent premounted on a 6 mm optiprobe. a balloon catheter was advanced across the area of narrowing and inflated with a nearcomplete disappearance of proximal waist. angiogram demonstrated a good stent apposition to the caval wall. further angioplasty was then performed utilizing an ultrathin sds 8 x 3 cm balloon catheter inflated to 19 atmospheres pressure with complete disappearance of a distinct proximal waist. angiogram demonstrated wide patency of reconstituted right caval pulmonary anastomosis though there was no flow seen to the right upper pulmonary artery. the balloon wedge angiograms were then obtained in the right upper pulmonary veins suggesting the presence of right upper pulmonary artery and not contiguous with the right lower pulmonary artery. bernstein catheter was advanced into the main pulmonary artery where a wire probing of the stump of the proximal right pulmonary artery facilitated access to the right upper pulmonary artery.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1562,angiogram demonstrated severe long segment stenosis of the proximal right pulmonary artery. angioplasty of the right pulmonary was then performed using the optiprobe 6mm balloon catheter inflated to 16 atmospheres pressure with disappearance of a distinct waist. repeat angiogram showed improvement in caliber of right upper pulmonary artery with filling defect of the proximal right pulmonary artery. the proximal right pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted using a pg 2980 bpx genesis stent premounted on 8mm optiprobe balloon catheter and implanted with complete disappearance of the waist. distal right upper pulmonary artery was then dilated and stent implanted utilizing a pg 1870 bpx genesis stent premounted on 7mm optiprobe balloon catheter. repeat angiograms were then performed. attention was then directed to the large venous collateral vessel arising from the left superior vena cava with a contrast filling of a leftsided azygos vein. a selective angiogram demonstrated a large azygos vein of the midsection measuring approximately 9.4 mm in diameter. an amplatzer 12 mm vascular plug was loaded on the delivery catheter and advanced through the flexor sheath into the azygos vein. once stable device was confirmed the device was released from the delivery catheter. the 4french bernstein catheter was then reintroduced and 5 inch empirical 0.038 inch 10 cm x 8 mm detachable coils were then implanted above the vascular plug filling the proximal azygos vein. a pigtail catheter was then introduced into the left superior vena cava for final angiogram.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1563,flows were calculated by the fick technique using an assumed oxygen consumption and contents derived from radiometer hemoximeter saturations and hemoglobin capacity. cineangiograms were obtained with injection of the coronary sinus of pulmonary veins the innominate vein superior vena cava the main pulmonary artery and azygos vein. after angiography two normalappearing renal collecting systems were visualized. the catheters and sheaths were removed and topical pressure applied for hemostasis. the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. there were no complications. discussion oxygen consumption was assumed to be normal mixed venous saturation but was low due to systemic arterial desaturation of 79. the pulmonary veins were fully saturated with partial pressure of oxygen ranging between 120 and 169 mmhg in 30 oxygen. remaining saturations reflected complete admixture. there was increased saturation in the left pulmonary artery due to aortopulmonary collateral flow. phasic right atrial pressures were normal with an awave somewhat to the normal right ventricular enddiastolic pressure of 9 mmhg. left ventricular systolic pressure was systemic with no outflow obstruction to the ascending aorta. phasic ascending descending pressures were similar and normal. mean glenn pressures at initiation of the case were slightly elevated at 14 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 9 mmhg. the calculated systemic flow was a normal pulmonary flows reduced with a qpqs ratio of 0.61. the pulmonary vascular resistance was elevated at 4.4 woods units.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1564,following stent implantation in the right caval pulmonary anastomosis and right pulmonary artery there was a slight increase in the glenn venous pressures to 16 mmhg. following embolization of the azygos vein there was increase in systemic arterial saturation to 84 and increase in mixed venous saturation. there was similar increase in glenn pressures to 28 mmhg with a transpulmonary gradient of 14 mmhg. there was an increase in arterial pressure. the calculated systemic flow increased from 3.1 liters minutemeter squared to 4.3 litersminutemeter squared. angiogram within the innominate vein following stent implantation demonstrated appropriate stent position without significant distortion of the innominate vein or proximal cava. there appeared unobstructed contrast flow to the right lower pulmonary artery of a 1mmhg mean pressure gradient. there was absence of contrast filling of the right middle and right upper pulmonary artery. final angiogram with a contrast injection in the left superior vena cava showed a forward flow through the right glenn a good contrast filling of the right lower pulmonary artery and a widely patent left glenn negative contrast washout of the proximal right pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery presumably due to aortopulmonary collateral flow. contrast injection within the right upper pulmonary artery following the stent implantation demonstrated widely patent proximal right pulmonary artery along the length of the implanted stents though with retrograde contrast flow. initial diagnoses asplenia syndrome. dextrocardia bilateral superior vena cava. atrioventricular septal defect. total anomalous pulmonary venous return to the rightsided atrium.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1582,reason for visit this is a routine return appointment for this 71yearold woman with chronic atrial fibrillation. her chief complaint today is shortness of breath. history of present illness i last saw her in 092008. since then she has been admitted to abcd hospital from 11052008 through 11082008 for a near syncopal episode. she was found to have a fast heart rate in the atrial fibrillation. she was also found to be in heart failure and so they diuresed her. they wanted to send her home on furosemide 40 mg daily but unfortunately they never gave her a prescription for this and so she now is not on any furosemide and since being discharged she has regained fluid to no ones great surprise. my plan advent is to control her heart rate. this has been a bit difficult with her retaining fluid. we will try again to diurese her as an outpatient and go forward from there with rate control and anticoagulation. she may need to have a pacemaker placed and her av node ablated if this does not work. she notes the shortness of breath and wheezing at nights. i think these are manifestations of heart failure. she has peripheral edema. she is short of breath when she tries to walk a city block. i believe she takes her medications as directed but i am never sure she actually is taking them correctly. in any case she did not bring her medications with her today.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1583,today she had an ecg which shows atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 117 beats per minute. there is a nonspecific ivcd. this is unchanged from her last visit except that her heart rate is faster. in addition i reviewed her echocardiogram done at xyz. her ejection fraction is 50 and she has paradoxical septal motion. her right ventricular systolic pressure is normal. there are no significant valvular abnormalities. medications fosamax 70 mg weekly. lisinopril 20 mg daily. metformin 850 mg daily. amlodipine 5 mg daily. metoprolol 150 mg twice daily. warfarin 5 mg daily. furosemide none. potassium none. magnesium oxide 200 mg daily. allergies denied. major findings on my comprehensive cardiovascular examination she again looks the same which is in heart failure. her blood pressure today was 13060 and her pulse 116 blood pressure and regular. she is 5 feet 11 inches and her weight is 167 pounds which is up from 158 pounds from when i saw her last visit. she is breathing 1two times per minute and it is unlabored. eyelids are normal. she has vitiligo. pupils are round and reactive to light. conjunctivae are clear and sclerae are anicteric. there is no oral thrush or central cyanosis. she has marked keloid formation on both sides of her neck the left being worse than the right. the jugular venous pressure is elevated. carotids are brisk are without bruits. lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. the precordium is quiet. the rhythm is irregularly irregular.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1584,she has a variable first and second heart sounds. no murmurs today. abdomen is soft without hepatosplenomegaly or masses although she does have hepatojugular reflux. she has no clubbing or cyanosis but does have 1 peripheral edema. distal pulses are good. on neurological examination her mentation is normal. her mood and affect are normal. she is oriented to person place and time. assessments she has chronic atrial fibrillation and heart failure now. problems diagnoses chronic atrial fibrillation anticoagulated and the plan is rate control. heart failure and she needs more diuretic. high blood pressure controlled. hyperlipidemia. diabetes mellitus type 2. nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay. history of alcohol abuse. osteoporosis. normal left ventricular function. procedures and immunizations none today. plans i have restarted her lasix at 80 mg daily and i have asked her to return in about 10 days to the heart failure clinic. there i would like them to recheck her heart rate and if still elevated and she is truly on 150 mg of metoprolol twice a day one could switch her amlodipine from 5 mg daily to diltiazem 120 mg daily. if this does not work in terms of controlling her heart rate then she will need to have a pacemaker and her av node ablated. thank you for asking me to participate in her care. medication changes see the above.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1585,preoperative diagnosis left chest wall tumor spindle cell histology. postoperative diagnosis left chest wall tumor spindle cell histology with pathology pending. procedure resection of left chest wall tumor partial resection of left diaphragm left lower lobe lung wedge resection left chest wall reconstruction with goretex mesh. anesthesia general endotracheal. specimen left chest wall with tumor and left lower lobe lung wedge resection to pathology. indications for procedure the patient is a 79yearold male who began to experience back pain approximately 2 years ago which increased. chest xray and ct scan revealed a 3 cm x 4 cm mass abutting the left chest wall inferior to the left scapula with pleural thickening. a biopsy was performed at an outside hospital kaiser and pathology was consistent with mesothelioma. the patient had a metastatic workup which was negative including a brain mri and bone scan. the bone scan showed only signal positivity in the left 9th rib near the tumor. the patient has a significant past medical history consisting of coronary artery disease hypertension noninsulin dependent diabetes longstanding atrial fibrillation anemia and hypercholesterolemia. he and his family were apprised of the highrisk nature of this surgery preoperatively and informed consent was obtained. procedure in detail the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. the patient was intubated with a doublelumen endotracheal tube. intravenous antibiotics were given. a foley catheter was placed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1586,the patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position and the left chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. an incision approximately 8 inches long was made centered over the mass and extending slightly obliquely over the mass. the skin and subcutaneous tissues were dissected sharply with the electrocautery. good hemostasis was obtained. the tumor was easily palpable and clearly involving the 8th to 9th rib. a thoracotomy was initially made above the mass in approximately the 7th intercostal space. inspection of the pleural cavity revealed multiple adhesions which were taken down with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection. the thoracotomy was extended anteriorly and posteriorly. it was clear that in order to obtain an adequate resection of the tumor approximately 4 rib segment of the chest wall would need to be resected. the ribs of the chest wall were first cut at their anterior aspect. the ribs 7 8 9 and 10 were serially transected after the interspaces were dissected with electrocautery. hemostasis was obtained with both electrocautery and clips. the chest wall segment to be resected was retracted laterally and posteriorly. it was clear that there were at least 2 areas where the tumor was invading the lung and a lengthy area of diaphragmatic involvement. inferiorly the diaphragm was divided to provide a margin of at least 1 to 2 cm around the areas of tumor. the spleen and the stomach were identified and were protected.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1587,inferiorly the resection of the chest wall was continued in the 10th interspace. the dissection was then carried posteriorly to the level of the spine. the left lung at this point was further dissected out and multiple firings of the gia 75 were used to perform a wedge resection of the left lower lobe which provided a complete resection of all palpable and visible tumor in the lung. a 20 silk tie was used to ligate the last remaining corner of lung parenchyma at the corner of the wedge resection. posteriorly the chest wall segment was noted to have an area at the level of approximately t8 and t9 where the tumor involved the vertebral bodies. the ribs were disarticulated closed to or at their articulations with the spine. bleeding from the intercostal vessels was controlled with a combination of clips and electrocautery. there was no disease grossly involving or encasing the aorta. the posterior transection of the ribs was completed and the specimen was passed off of the field as a specimen to pathology for permanent section. the specimen was oriented for the pathologist who came to the room. hemostasis was obtained. the vent in the diaphragm was then closed primarily with a series of figureof8 1 ethibond sutures. this produced a satisfactory diaphragmatic repair without undue tension. a single 32french chest tube was placed in the pleural cavity exiting the left hemithorax anteriorly. this was secured with a 1 silk suture.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1588,the goretex mesh was brought on to the field and was noted to be of adequate size to patch the resulting chest wall defect. a series of 1 prolene were placed in an interrupted horizontal mattress fashion circumferentially and tied down individually. the resulting mesh closure was snug and deemed adequate. the serratus muscle was reapproximated with figureof8 0 vicryl. the latissimus was reapproximated with a two 1 vicryl placed in running fashion. of note two 10 jp drains were placed over the mesh repair of the chest wall. the subcutaneous tissues were closed with a running 30 vicryl suture and the skin was closed with a 40 monocryl. the wounds were dressed. the patient was brought from the operating room directly to the north icu intubated in stable condition. all counts were correct.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1589,preoperative diagnosis bilateral pleural effusion. postoperative diagnosis bilateral pleural effusion. procedure performed removal of bilateral 32french chest tubes with closure of wound. complications none. indications for procedure the patient is a 66yearold africanamerican male who has been in the intensive care unit for over a month with bilateral chest tubes for chronic draining pleural effusions with serous drainage. a decision was made to proceed with removal of these chest tubes and because of the fistulous tracts this necessitated to close the wounds with sutures. the patient was agreeable to proceed. operative procedure the patient was prepped and draped at the bedside over both chest tube sites. the pressures applied over the sites and the skin was closed with interrupted 30 ethilon sutures. the skin was then cleansed and vaseline occlusive dressing was applied over the sites. the same procedure was performed on the other side. the chest tubes were removed on full inspiration. vital signs remained stable throughout the procedure. the patient will remain in the intensive care unit for continued monitoring.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1624,dear sample doctor thank you for referring mr. sample patient for cardiac evaluation. this is a 67yearold obese male who has a history of therapycontrolled hypertension borderline diabetes and obesity. he has a family history of coronary heart disease but denies any symptoms of angina pectoris or effort intolerance. specifically no chest discomfort of any kind no dyspnea on exertion unless extreme exertion is performed no orthopnea or pnd. he is known to have a mother with coronary heart disease. he has never been a smoker. he has never had a syncopal episode mi or cva. he had his gallbladder removed. no bleeding tendencies. no history of dvt or pulmonary embolism. the patient is retired rarely consumes alcohol and consumes coffee moderately. he apparently has a sleep disorder according to his wife not in the office the patient snores and stops breathing during sleep. he is allergic to codeine and aspirin angioedema. physical exam revealed a middleaged man weighing 283 pounds for a height of 5 feet 11 inches. his heart rate was 98 beats per minute and regular. his blood pressure was 14080 mmhg in the right arm in a sitting position and 15080 mmhg in a standing position. he is in no distress. venous pressure is normal. carotid pulsations are normal without bruits. the lungs are clear. cardiac exam was normal. the abdomen was obese and organomegaly was not palpated. there were no pulsatile masses or bruits.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1625,the femoral pulses were 3 in character with a symmetrical distribution and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibiales were 3 in character. there was no peripheral edema. he had a chemistry profile which suggests diabetes mellitus with a fasting blood sugar of 136 mgdl. renal function was normal. his lipid profile showed a slight increase in triglycerides with normal total cholesterol and hdl and an acceptable range of ldl. his sodium was a little bit increased. his a1c hemoglobin was increased. he had a spirometry which was reported as normal. he had a resting electrocardiogram on december 20 2002 which was also normal. he had a treadmill cardiolite which was performed only to stage 2 and was terminated by the supervising physician when the patient achieved 90 of the predicted maximum heart rate. there were no symptoms or ischemia by ekg. there was some suggestion of inferior wall ischemia with normal wall motion by cardiolite imaging. in summary we have a 67yearold gentleman with risk factors for coronary heart disease. i am concerned with possible diabetes and a likely metabolic syndrome of this gentleman with truncal obesity hypertension possible insulin resistance and some degree of fasting hyperglycemia as well as slight triglyceride elevation. he denies any symptoms of coronary heart disease but he probably has some degree of coronary atherosclerosis possibly affecting the inferior wall by functional testings. in view of the absence of symptoms medical therapy is indicated at the present time with very aggressive risk factor modification.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1626,i explained and discussed extensively with the patient the benefits of regular exercise and a walking program was given to the patient. he also should start aggressively losing weight. i have requested additional testing today which will include an apolipoprotein b lpa lipoprotein as well as homocystine and cardio crp to further assess his risk of atherosclerosis. in terms of medication i have changed his verapamil for a long acting betablocker he should continue on an ace inhibitor and his plavix. the patient is allergic to aspirin. i also will probably start him on a statin if any of the studies that i have recommended come back abnormal and furthermore if he is confirmed to have diabetes. along this line perhaps we should consider obtaining the advice of an endocrinologist to decide whether this gentleman needs treatment for diabetes which i believe he should. this however i will leave entirely up to you to decide. if indeed he is considered to be a diabetic a much more aggressive program should be entertained for reducing the risks of atherosclerosis in general and coronary artery disease in particular. i do not find an indication at this point in time to proceed with any further testing such as coronary angiography in the absence of symptoms. if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to let me know. thank you once again for this kind referral. sincerely sample doctor m.d.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1659,after in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less longterm side effects past the acute procedure alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation andor heart rate control with anticoagulation which the patient was not interested nor was i primarily recommending as the next step and risks including but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an allinclusive list but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents which would be less likely as i did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules he did have a 5.5second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy statistically less significant risk of cva although we cannot really make that null. the patient expressed understanding of this risk benefit and alternative analysis. i invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their selfstated satisfaction we planned to go forward with the procedure.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1660,procedure note the patient received a total of 7 mg of versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titratedown sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate timeout procedure had been done as per the medical center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient position procedure documentation procedure indication and there were no questions. the patient did actively participate in this timeout procedure. after the universal protocol was done he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using lollipop posterior patch with handsdriven paddle on the side which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy. there was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 1209 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12lead ekg. impression cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on coumadin and his inr is 3.22. we are going to watch him and discharge him from the medical center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening atenolol 25 mg once a day coumadin as currently being diagnosed. i had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again dr. x at electrophysiology unit at general hospital and i will be planning to place a call for dr. x myself.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1661,again he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and i suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms. i had previously discussed the case with dr. y who is the patients general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patients bedside regarding our findings.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1795,preprocedure diagnosis left leg claudication. postprocedure diagnosis left leg claudication. operation performed aortogram with bilateral segmental lower extremity run off. anesthesia conscious sedation. indication for procedure the patient presents with lower extremity claudication. she is a 68yearold woman who is very fearful of the aforementioned procedures. risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to her to include bleeding infection arterial trauma requiring surgery access issues and recurrence. she appears to understand and agrees to proceed. description of procedure the patient was taken to the angio suite placed in a supine position. after adequate conscious sedation both groins were prepped with chloraseptic prep. cloth towels and paper drapes were placed. local anesthesia was administered in the common femoral artery and using ultrasound guidance the common femoral artery was accessed. guidewire was threaded followed by a 4french sheath. through the 4french sheath a 4french omni flush catheter was placed. the glidewire was removed and contrast administered to identify the level of the renal artery. using power injector an aortogram proceeded. the catheter was then pulled down to the aortic bifurcation. a timed runoff view of both legs was performed and due to a very abnormal and delayed runoff in the left i opted to perform an angiogram of the left lower extremity with an isolated approach. the catheter was pulled down to the aortic bifurcation and using a glidewire i obtained access to the contralateral left external iliac artery.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1796,the omni flush catheter was advanced to the left distal external iliac artery. the glidewire rather exchanged for an amplatz stiff wire. this was left in place and the 4french sheath removed and replaced with a 6french destination 45cm sheath. this was advanced into the proximal superficial femoral artery and an angiogram performed. i identified a functionally occluded distal superficial femoral artery and after obtaining views of the run off made plans for angioplasty. the patient was given 5000 units of heparin and this was allowed to circulate. a glidewire was carefully advanced using roadmapping techniques through the functionally occluded blood vessels. a 4mm x 4cm angioplasty balloon was used to dilate the area in question. final views after dilatation revealed a dissection. a search for a 5mm stent was performed but none of this was available. for this reason i used a 6mm x 80mm marked stent and placed this at the distal superficial femoral artery. post dilatation was performed with a 4mm angioplasty balloon. further views of the left lower extremity showed irregular change in the popliteal artery. no significant stenosis could be identified in the left popliteal artery and noninvasive scan. for this reason i chose not to treat any further areas in the left leg. i then performed closure of the right femoral artery with a 6french angioseal device. attention was turned to the left femoral artery and local anesthesia administered. access was obtained with the ultrasound and the femoral artery identified.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1797,guidewire was threaded followed by a 4french sheath. this was immediately exchanged for the 6french destination sheath after the glidewire was used to access the distal external iliac artery. the glidewire was exchanged for the amplatz stiff wire to place the destination sheath. the destination was placed in the proximal superficial femoral artery and angiogram obtained. initial views had been obtained from the right femoral sheath before removal. views of the right superficial femoral artery demonstrated significant stenosis with accelerated velocities in the popliteal and superficial femoral artery. for this reason i performed the angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using the 4mm balloon. a minimal dissection plane measuring less than 1 cm was identified at the proximal area of dilatation. no further significant abnormality was identified. to avoid placing a stent in the small vessel i left it alone and approached the popliteal artery. a 3mm balloon was chosen to dilate a 50 to 79 popliteal artery stenosis. reasonable use were obtained and possibly a 4mm balloon could have been used. however due to her propensity for dissection i opted not to. i then exchanged the glidewire for an o1 for thruway guidewire using an exchange length. this was placed into the left posterior tibial artery. a 2mm balloon was used to dilate the orifice of the posterior tibial artery. i then moved the wire to the perineal artery and dilated the proximal aspect of this vessel. final images showed improved runoff to the right calf.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1798,the destination sheath was pulled back into the left external iliac artery and an angioseal deployed. findings aortogram demonstrates a dual right renal artery with the inferior renal artery supplying the lower one third of the right renal parenchyma. no evidence of renal artery stenosis is noted bilaterally. there is a single left renal artery. the infrarenal aorta both common iliac and the external iliac arteries are normal. on the right a superficial femoral artery is widely patent and normal proximally. at the distal third of the thigh there is diffuse disease with moderate stenosis noted. moderate stenosis is also noted in the popliteal artery and single vessel runoff through the posterior tibial artery is noted. the perineal artery is functionally occluded at the midcalf. the dorsal pedal artery filled by collateral at the high ankle level. on the left the proximal superficial femoral artery is patent. again at the distal third of the thigh there is a functional occlusion of the superficial femoral artery with poor collateralization to the high popliteal artery. this was successfully treated with angioplasty and a stent placement. the popliteal artery is diffusely diseased without focal stenosis. the tibioperoneal trunk is patent and the anterior tibial artery occluded at its orifice. impression normal bilateral renal arteries with a small accessory right renal artery. normal infrarenal aorta as well as normal bilateral common and external iliac arteries. the proximal right renal artery is normal with moderately severe stenosis in the superficial femoral popliteal and tibial arteries.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1800,diagnosis aortic valve stenosis with coronary artery disease associated with congestive heart failure. the patient has diabetes and is morbidly obese. procedures aortic valve replacement using a mechanical valve and twovessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure using saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery and left radial artery graft to the left anterior descending artery. anesthesia general endotracheal incision median sternotomy indications the patient presented with severe congestive heart failure associated with the patients severe diabetes. the patient was found to have moderately stenotic aortic valve. in addition the patient had significant coronary artery disease consisting of a chronically occluded right coronary artery but a very important large obtuse marginal artery coming off as the main circumflex system. the patient also has a left anterior descending artery which has moderate disease and this supplies quite a bit of collateral to the patients right system. it was decided to perform a valve replacement as well as coronary artery bypass grafting procedure. findings the left ventricle is certainly hypertrophied the aortic valve leaflet is calcified and a severe restrictive leaflet motion. it is a tricuspid type of valve. the coronary artery consists of a large left anterior descending artery which is associated with 60 stenosis but a large obtuse marginal artery which has a tight proximal stenosis. the radial artery was used for the left anterior descending artery. flow was excellent. looking at the targets in the posterior descending artery territory there did not appear to be any large branches.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1801,on the angiogram these vessels appeared to be quite small. because this is a chronically occluded vessel and the patient has limited conduit due to the patients massive obesity attempt to bypass to this area was not undertaken. the patient was brought to the operating room procedure the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. a median sternotomy incision was carried out and conduits were taken from the left arm as well as the right thigh. the patient weighs nearly three hundred pounds. there was concern as to taking down the left internal mammary artery. because the radial artery appeared to be a good conduit the patient would have arterial graft to the left anterior descending artery territory. the patient was cannulated after the aorta and atrium were exposed and full heparinization. the patient went on cardiopulmonary bypass and the aortic crossclamp was applied cardioplegia was delivered through the coronary sinuses in a retrograde manner. the patient was cooled to 32 degrees. iced slush was applied to the heart. the aortic valve was then exposed through the aortic root by transverse incision. the valve leaflets were removed and the 23 st. jude mechanical valve was secured into position by circumferential pledgeted sutures. at this point aortotomy was closed. the first obtuse marginal artery was a very large target and the vein graft to this target indeed produced an excellent amount of flow. proximal anastomosis was then carried out to the foot of the aorta.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1802,the left anterior descending artery does not have severe disease but is also a very good target and the radial artery was anastomosed to this target in an endtoside manner. the two proximal anastomoses were then carried out to the root of the aorta. the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass after aortic crossclamp was released. the patient was adequately warmed. protamine was given without adverse effect. sternal closure was then done using wires. the subcutaneous layers were closed using vicryl suture. the skin was approximated using staples.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1803,preoperative diagnosis aortoiliac occlusive disease. postoperative diagnosis aortoiliac occlusive disease. procedure performed aortobifemoral bypass. operative findings the patient was taken to the operating room. the abdominal contents were within normal limits. the aorta was of normal size and consistency consistent with arteriosclerosis. a 16x8 mm goretex graft was placed without difficulty. the femoral vessels were small somewhat thin and there was posterior packing but satisfactory bypass was performed. procedure the patient was taken to the operating room placed in a supine position and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner with betadine solution. a longitudinal incision was made after a betadinecoated drape was placed over the incisional area. longitudinal incision was made over each groin initially and carried down to the subcutaneous fat and fascia. hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. the common deep and superficial femoral arteries were exposed and then these incisions were covered with antibiotic soaked sponges. attention was then turned to the abdomen where a longitudinal incision was made from the pubis xiphoid carried down subcutaneous fat and fascia. hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. the abdomen was entered above the umbilicus and then this was extended with care inferiorly as the patient has undergone previous abdominal surgery. mild adhesions were lysed. the omentum was freed. the small and large intestine were run with no evidence of abnormalities. the liver and gallbladder were within normal limits. no abnormalities were noted. at this point the bookwalter retractor was placed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1804,ng tube was placed in the stomach and placed on suction. the intestines were gently packed intraabdominally and laterally. the rest of the peritoneum was then opened. the aorta was cleared both proximally and distally. the left iliac was completely occluded. the right iliac was to be cleansed. at this point 5000 units of aqueous heparin was administered to allow take effect. the aorta was then clamped below the renal arteries and opened in a longitudinal fashion. a single lumbar was ligated with 30 prolene. the inferior mesenteric artery was occluded intraluminally and required no suture closure. care was taken to preserve collaterals. the aorta was measured and a 16 mm goretex graft was brought on the field and anastomosed to the proximal aorta using 30 prolene in a running fashion. last stitch was tied. hemostasis was excellent. the clamp was gradually removed and additional prolene was placed in the right posterolateral aspect to obtain better hemostasis. at this point strong pulses were present within the graft. the limbs were vented and irrigated. using bimanual technique the retroperitoneal tunnels were developed immediately on top of the iliac arteries into the groin. the grafts were then brought through these care being taken to avoid twisting of the graft. at this point the right iliac was then ligated using 0 vicryl and the clamp was removed. hemostasis was excellent. the right common femoral artery was then clamped proximally and distally opened with 11 blade extended with potts scissors.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1805,the graft was and anastomosed to the artery using 50 prolene in a continuous fashion with a stitch running fashion. prior to tying the last stitch the graft and artery were vented and the last stitch was tied. flow was initially restored proximally then distally with good results. attention was then turned to the left groin and the artery grafts were likewise exposed cleared proximally and distally. the artery was opened extended with a potts scissors and anastomosis was performed with 50 prolene again with satisfactory hemostasis. the last stitch was tied. strong pulses were present within the artery and graft itself. at this point 25 mg of protamine was administered. the wounds were irrigated with antibiotic solution. the groins were repacked. attention was then returned to the abdomen. the retroperitoneal area and the anastomotic sites were checked for bleeding and none was present. the shell of the aorta was closed over the proximal anastomosis and the retroperitoneum was then repaired over the remaining portions of the graft. the intraabdominal contents were then allowed to resume their normal position. there was no evidence of ischemia to the large or small bowel. at this point the omentum and stomach were repositioned. the abdominal wall was closed in a running single layer fashion using 1 pds. the skin was closed with skin staples. the groins were again irrigated closed with 30 vicryl and 40 undyed vicryl and steristrips.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1813,abc is a 74yearold woman admitted to the hospital with a fall and she has a history of vascular dementia so her history is somewhat unreliable it seems and she is somnolent at that time. she does have chronic atrial fibrillation again documented at least present since 2007 and i found an ekg report by dr. x which shows atrial fibrillation on 082907 per her report. one of the questions we were asked was whether the patient would be a candidate for coumadin. clearly given her history of small ministrokes i think coumadin would be appropriate given this chronic atrial fibrillation but the main issue is the fall risk. if not felt to be significant fall risk then i would strongly recommend coumadin as the patient herself states that she has only fallen twice in the past year. i would defer that decision to dr. z and dr. xy who know the patient well and it may be that physical therapy consult is appropriate to help adjudicate. recommendations fall assessment as per dr. z and dr. xy with possible pt consult if felt appropriate and if the patient is not felt to be at significant fall risk would put her on coumadin. given her history of small strokes as documented in the chart and her chronic atrial fibrillation she does have reasonable heart rate control on current labetalol.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1814,the patient has elevated bnp and i suspect that is due to her severe pulmonary hypertension and renal failure and in the light of normal lv function i would not make any further evaluation of that other than aggressive diuresis. regarding this minimal troponin elevation i do not feel this is a diagnosis especially in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and her smalltomoderate sized stable pericardial effusion again that has been longstanding since 2007 from what i can tell and there is no evidence of tamponade. i would defer to her usual cardiologist dr. x whether an outpatient stress evaluation is appropriate for risk stratification. i did find that the patient had a prior cardiac stress test in 0807 where they felt that there was some subtle reversibility of the anterior wall but it was felt that it may be artifact rather than true ischemia with normal lv function seen on that study as well. continue norvasc for history of hypertension as well as labetalol. the patient is felt to be a significant fall risk and will at least continue her aspirin 81 mg once a day for secondary cva thromboprophylaxis albeit understanding that it is inferior to coumadin. continue dilantin for history of seizures.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1828,the completion angiogram showed that there was a dissection of the left external iliac artery which precluded flow down into the left lower extremity. we then had to come up and perform angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery as well as aggressively dilating the takeoff of the less superficial femoral artery from the common femoral artery. the left superficial femoral artery was dilated with a 6mm balloon. the left external iliac artery and common femoral arteries were dilated with an 8mm balloon. a 2.5mm clearpath laser probe was used to initially arthrectomize and debulk the superficial femoral artery starting at its takeoff from the common femoral artery and extending down to the tight stenotic area in the upper onethird of the thigh. after the laser atherectomy was performed the area still did not look good and so an angioplasty was then done which looked good however as noted above after we had dealt with the superficial femoral artery we then had proximal inflow problems which had to be dealt by angioplasty and stenting. the patient had good dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally upon completion. the right common femoral artery was used for access in an upandover technique. procedure with the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. the right common femoral artery was punctured percutaneously and a 5french sheath was initially placed.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1829,we used a pigtail catheter to go up and over the aortic bifurcation and placed a stiff amplatz guidewire down into the left common femoral artery. we then heparinized the patient and placed a 7french raby sheath over the amplatz wire. a selective left lower extremity angiogram was then done with the abovenoted findings. we then used a clearpath 2.5mm laser probe to laser the proximal superficial femoral artery. because of the findings as noted above this became more involved than initially hoped for. once the laser atherectomy had been completed the vessel still did not look good so we used a 6mm balloon to thoroughly dilate the area. once that had been done it looked good and we performed what we felt would be a completion angiogram only to find out that we had a more proximal problem precluding flow down into the left femoral artery. once that was discovered we then had to proceed with angioplasty and stenting of the left external iliac artery right down to the acetabular level. once we had dealt with our runon problems we then did another completion angiogram which showed a good flow through the entire area and down into the left lower extremity. following completion of the above all wires sheaths and catheters were removed from the right common femoral artery. firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes followed by application of a sterile coverlet dressing and a firm pressure dressing.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1831,angina is chest pain due to a lack of oxygen to the heart most often occurring in men age 35 or older and postmenopausal women. it is usually located right under the breast bone. physical and emotional stress as well as eating heavy meals can bring it on. in a healthy person these stresses are easily handled. in a person with an underlying heart condition like coronary artery disease heart valve problem arrhythmias or high blood pressure the heart doesnt get enough blood i.e. not enough oxygen to the heart muscles. other causes could be due to a hyperactive thyroid disorder or anemia. people more likely to have angina may also have diabetes mellitus be overweight smoke have a poor diet with lots of salt and fat fail to exercise have a stressful workload or have a family history of coronary artery disease. signs and symptoms pain in chest described as tightness heavy pressure aching or squeezing. the pain sometimes radiates to the jaw left arm teeth andor outer ear. possibly a leftsided numbness tingling or pain in the arm shoulder elbow or chest. occasionally a sudden difficulty in breathing occurs. pain may be located between the shoulder blades. treatment nitroglycerin relieves the immediate symptoms of angina in seconds. carry it with you at all times. other medications may be prescribed for the underlying heart problems. it is important to take them as prescribed by your doctor.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1832,surgery may be necessary to open the blocked coronary arteries balloon angioplasty or to bypass them. correct the contributing factors you have control over. lose weight dont smoke eat a lowsalt lowfat diet and avoid physical and emotional stresses that cause angina. such stressors include anger overworking going between extremes in hot and cold sudden physical exertion and high altitudes pressurized airplanes arent a risk. practice relaxation techniques. exercise discuss first what you are able to do with your doctor and then go do it. even with treatment angina may result in a heart attack congestive heart failure or a fatal abnormal heartbeat. treatment decreases the odds that these will occur. let your doctor know if your angina doesnt go away after 10 minutes even when you have taken a nitroglycerin tablet. call if you have repeated chest pains that awaken you from sleep regardless if the nitroglycerin helps. if your pain changes or feels different call your doctor or call 911 if the pain is severe.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1836,history of present illness the patient is a 68yearold woman whom i have been following who has had angina. in any case today she called me because she had a recurrent left arm pain after her stent three days ago and this persisted after two sublingual nitroglycerin when i spoke to her. i advised her to call 911 which she did. while waiting for 911 she was attended to by a physician who is her neighbor and he advised her to take the third nitroglycerin and that apparently relieved her pain. by the time she presented here she is currently painfree and is feeling well. past cardiac history the patient has been having arm pain for several months. she underwent an exercise stress echocardiogram within the last several months with me which was equivocal but then she had a nuclear stress test which showed inferobasilar ischemia. i had originally advised her for a heart catheterization but she wanted medical therapy so we put her on a betablocker. however her arm pain symptoms accelerated and she had some jaw pain so she presented to the emergency room. on 081608 she ended up having a cardiac catheterization and that showed normal left main 80 mid lad lesion circumflex normal and rca totally occluded in the mid portion and there were collaterals from the left to the right as well as right to right to that area.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
1837,the decision was made to transfer her as she may be having collateral insufficiency from the lad stenosis to the rca vessel. she underwent that with drugeluting stents on 081608 with i believe three or four total placed and was discharged on 081708. she had some left arm discomfort on 081808 but this was mild. yesterday she felt very fatigued but no arm pain and today she had arm pain after walking and again it resolved now completely after three sublingual nitroglycerin. this is her usual angina. she is being admitted with unstable angina post stent. past medical history longstanding hypertension cad as above hyperlipidemia and overactive bladder. medications detrol la 2 mg once a day. prilosec for gerd 20 mg once a day. glucosamine 500400 mg once a day for arthritis. multivitamin p.o. daily. nitroglycerin sublingual as available to her. toprolxl 25 mg once a day which i started although she had been bradycardic but she seems to be tolerating. aspirin 325 mg once a day. plavix 75 mg once a day. diovan 160 mg once a day. claritin 10 mg once a day for allergic rhinitis. norvasc 5 mg once a day. lipitor 5 mg once a day. evista 60 mg once a day. allergies allergies to medications are none. she denies any shrimp or sea food allergy. family history her father died of an mi in his 50s and a brother had his first mi and bypass surgery at 54.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary

1840,i am going to add imdur and watch headaches as she apparently had some on nitro paste before and we will rule out mi although there is a little suspicion. i suppose it is possible that she has noncardiac arm pain but that seems less likely as it has been nitrate responsive and seems exertionally related and the other possibility may be that we end up needing to put in a pacemaker so we can maximize betablocker use for antianginal effect. my concern is that there is persistent right coronary artery ischemia not helped by left anterior descending percutaneous coronary intervention which was severely stenotic and she does have normal lv function. she will continue the glucosamine for her arthritis claritin for allergies and detrol la for urinary incontinence. total patient care time in the emergency department 75 minutes. all this was discussed in detail with the patient and her daughter who expressed understanding and agreement. the patient desires full resuscitation status.,Cardiovascular / Pulmonary
